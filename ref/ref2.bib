	abstract = {Surgical robots are gaining favor in part due to their capacity to reach remote locations within the body. Continuum robots are especially well suited for accessing deep spaces such as cerebral ventricles within the brain. Due to the entry point constraints and complicated structure, current techniques do not allow surgeons to access the full volume of the ventricles. The ability to access the ventricles with a dexterous robot would have significant clinical implications. This paper presents a concentric tube manipulator mated to a robotically controlled flexible endoscope. The device adds three degrees of freedom to the standard neuroendoscope and roboticizes the entire package allowing the operator to conveniently manipulate the device. To demonstrate the improved functionality, we use an in-silica virtual model as well as an ex-vivo anatomic model of a patient with a treatable form of hydrocephalus. In these experiments we demonstrate that the augmented and roboticized endoscope can efficiently reach critical regions that a manual scope cannot.},

The contribution of this paper lies in the design of a novel potential field in the actuator space satisfying the mechanical constraints of the manipulator.

	abstract = {This paper presents a new class of thin, dexterous continuum robots, which we call active cannulas due to their potential medical applications. An active cannula is composed of telescoping, concentric, precurved superelastic tubes that can be axially translated and rotated at the base relative to one another. Active cannulas derive bending not from tendon wires or other external mechanisms but from elastic tube interaction in the backbone itself, permitting high dexterity and small size, and dexterity improves with miniaturization. They are designed to traverse narrow and winding environments without relying on ldquoguidingrdquo environmental reaction forces. These features seem ideal for a variety of applications where a very thin robot with tentacle-like dexterity is needed. In this paper, we apply beam mechanics to obtain a kinematic model of active cannula shape and describe design tools that result from the modeling process. After deriving general equations, we apply them to a simple three-link active cannula. Experimental results illustrate the importance of including torsional effects and the ability of our model to predict energy bifurcation and active cannula shape.},

	abstract = {Concentric tube robots are catheter-sized continuum robots that are well suited for minimally invasive surgery inside confined body cavities. These robots are constructed from sets of precurved superelastic tubes and are capable of assuming complex 3-D curves. The family of 3-D curves that the robot can assume depends on the number, curvatures, lengths, and stiffnesses of the tubes in its tube set. The robot design problem involves solving for a tube set that will produce the family of curves necessary to perform a surgical procedure. At a minimum, these curves must enable the robot to smoothly extend into the body and to manipulate tools over the desired surgical workspace while respecting anatomical constraints. This paper introduces an optimization framework that utilizes procedure- or patient-specific image-based anatomical models along with surgical workspace requirements to generate robot tube set designs. The algorithm searches for designs that minimize robot length and curvature and for which all paths required for the procedure consist of stable robot configurations. Two mechanics-based kinematic models are used. Initial designs are sought using a model assuming torsional rigidity. These designs are then refined using a torsionally compliant model. The approach is illustrated with clinically relevant examples from neurosurgery and intracardiac surgery.},

In this paper, we detail methods for the efficient numerical solution of this model at rates that enable real-time interactive simulation, motion planning, design optimization, and control. Exploitation of the model structure enables a significant reduction in the number of integrations required to evaluate the boundary value Jacobian matrix used in a shooting method.

Another reason is the dynamic coupling between the actuators that cannot be neglected during fast motions.

Using feedback linearization, the actuators can be decoupled and feedforward control in combination with linear controllers can be applied. Measurements of an example manipulator show the good tracking result of pure feedforward action with feedback linearization. Adding a linear PD-controller increases the robustness against disturbances without reducing the possibility of fast motions.},

In this paper we develop a new coordinate-free energy formulation that accounts for general preshaping of an arbitrary number of component tubes, and which explicitly includes both bending and torsion throughout the device. We show that previously reported models are special cases of our formulation, and then explore in detail the implications of torsional flexibility for the special case of two tubes. Experiments demonstrate that this framework is more descriptive of physical prototype behavior than previous models1 it reduces model prediction error by 82\% over the calibrated bending-only model, and 17\% over the calibrated transmissional torsion model in a set of experiments.},

Advantages of this method are that the model is constantly tuning itself to provide high accuracy in the region of the workspace where it is currently operating. It also adapts automatically to changes in robot shape and compliance associated with the insertion and removal of tools through its lumen.

	abstract = {Variable length multisection continuum arms are a class of continuum robotic manipulators that generate motion by structural mechanical deformation. Unlike most continuum robots, the sections of these arms do not have (central) supporting flexible backbone, and are actuated by multiple variable length actuators. Because of the constraining nature of actuators, the continuum sections can bend and/or elongate (compress) depending on the elongation/contraction characteristics of the actuators being used. Continuum arms have a number of distinctive differences with respect to traditional rigid arms namely: smooth bending, high inherent compliance, and adaptive whole arm grasping. However, due to numerical instability and the complexity of curve parametric models, there are no spatial dynamic models for multisection continuum arms. This paper introduces novel spatial dynamics and applies these to variable length multisection continuum arms with any number of sections. An efficient recursive computational scheme for deriving the equations of motion is presented. This is applied in a general form based on structurally accurate and numerically well-posed modal kinematics that assumes circular arc deformation of continuum sections without torsion. It is shown that the proposed modal dynamics are highly scalable, producing efficient and accurate numerical results. The spatial dynamic simulation results are experimentally validated using a pneumatic muscle actuated multisection prototype continuum arm. For the first time this enables investigation of spatial dynamic effects in this class of continuum arms.},

Actuator length limits shape the configuration or joint space of continuum manipulators, introducing couplings analyzed in this paper which must be understood to make effective use of continuum robot hardware. Based on the new understanding of the configuration space uncovered, this paper then derives the workspace of continuum robots when constrained by actuator length limits. Finally, a tangle/untangle algorithm correctly computes the shape of the distal segments of multisection tendon-actuated continuum robots. These contributions are essential for effective use of a wide range of continuum robots, and have been implemented and tested on two different types of continuum robots.

	doi = {10.1109/ICRA.2016.7487223},
	abstract = {Path following and follow-the-leader motion is particularly desirable for minimally-invasive surgery in confined spaces which can only be reached using tortuous paths, e.g. through natural orifices. While path following and followthe- leader motion can be achieved by hyper-redundant snake robots, their size is usually not applicable for medical applications. Continuum robots, such as tendon-driven or concentric tube mechanisms, fulfill the size requirements for minimally invasive surgery, but yet follow-the-leader motion is not inherently provided. In fact, parameters of the manipulator's section curvatures and translation have to be chosen wisely a priori. In this paper, we consider a tendon-driven continuum robot with extensible sections. After reformulating the forward kinematics model, we formulate prerequisites for follow-the-leader motion and present a general approach to determine a sequence of robot configurations to achieve follow-the-leader motion along a given 3D path. We evaluate our approach in a series of simulations with 3D paths composed of constant curvature arcs and general 3D paths described by B-spline curves. Our results show that mean path errors {\textless};0.4mm and mean tip errors {\textless};1.6mm can theoretically be achieved for constant curvature paths and {\textless};2mm and {\textless};3.1mm for general B-spline curves respectively.},

	abstract = {Continuum robotic manipulators articulate due to their inherent compliance. Tendon actuation leads to compression of the manipulator, extension of the actuators, and is limited by the practical constraint that tendons cannot support compression. In light of these observations, we present a new linear model for transforming desired beam configuration to tendon displacements and vice versa. We begin from first principles in solid mechanics by analyzing the effects of geometrically nonlinear tendon loads. These loads act both distally at the termination point and proximally along the conduit contact interface. The resulting model simplifies to a linear system including only the bending and axial modes of the manipulator as well as the actuator compliance. The model is then manipulated to form a concise mapping from beam configuration-space parameters to n redundant tendon displacements via the internal loads and strains experienced by the system. We demonstrate the utility of this model by implementing an optimal feasible controller. The controller regulates axial strain to a constant value while guaranteeing positive tendon forces and minimizing their magnitudes over a range of articulations. The mechanics-based model from this study provides insight as well as performance gains for this increasingly ubiquitous class of manipulators.},

The manipulator relies on the use of a soft flexible fluidic actuator in each of its modules, which can be wireless controlled by means of an embedded fluidic control unit. This actuation unit is equipped with three miniaturized latching valves, a wireless microcontroller board, and a specifically designed fluidic distributor integrated into the elastomeric material that the module is made of. FEM simulations and experimental tests verified the reliability of the distributor in acting as a piping system inside each module. The mobility of the fully integrated soft module was evaluated in terms of static performances and covered workspace. The module’s dynamic model during one-chamber motion was estimated from the parameter estimation analysis. The characterization of the single module behaviour is intended as first step to ease the future high level control of the multi-modular architecture.},

The actuation loading on the robot by the actuation rods is formulated based on the calculation of contact forces that result in rod equilibrium. Numerical optimization calculates the magnitudes of these forces, and an iterative solver simultaneously estimates the robot's friction and contact forces. In addition, modeling considerations including variable elastic loading among segments and mutual segment loading due to rods terminating at different disks are presented.

To implement a desired tip stiffness, the controller drives the actuators to positions corresponding to a deflected robot configuration that produces the required tip force for the measured tip position. This approach provides several important advantages. First, it enables the use of robot deflection sensing as a means to both sense and control tip forces. Second, it enables stiffness control to be implemented by modification of existing continuum robot position controllers. The proposed controller is demonstrated experimentally in the context of a concentric tube robot. Results show that the stiffness controller achieves the desired stiffness in steady state, provides good dynamic performance, and exhibits stability during contact transitions.},

The focus of this paper lies in the sensor-based position control of the ColoBot for guiding the advancement in a tubular, compliant and slippery environment. The kinematic model related the position of the distal end of the ColoBot to the actuator inputs which is firstly developed and formulated to control the shape of the ColoBot through position control of the distal tip. To achieve safe guidance, the ideal position of the tip should be in the central axis of the colon. A method based on a circumscribed circle is proposed to approximate the central position in real-time based on three sensor readings. This position will be used as reference position for the tip to adjust its shape in real time to avoid the contact with tube wall. This proposed approach can be extended to the control of continuum robots in the conditions of a dynamically confined space. The simulation results and experimental results with a curved tube will be presented in order to validate the proposed control strategy.},

A solution framework based on constraints of geometric compatibility and static equilibrium is derived using elliptic integrals. This framework allows the investigation of the effects of different external loads and actuation redundancy resolutions on the shape variations in these continuum robots. The simulation and experimental validation results show that these continuum robots bend into an exact circular shape for one particular actuation resolution. This provides a proof to the ubiquitously accepted circular-shape assumption in deriving kinematics for continuum robots. The shape variations due to various actuation redundancy resolutions are also investigated. The simulation results show that these continuum robots have the ability to redistribute loads among their backbones without introducing significant shape variations. A strategy for partially restoring the shape of the externally loaded continuum robots is proposed. The simulation results show that either the tip orientation or the tip position can be successfully restored.},

An essential aspect of this model is the inclusion of both the mechanical and geometrical coupling among serial articulating sections. Important capabilities of this model are the general forward kinematics and the decoupled inverse kinematics that allow for independent control of multiple sections.

manipulators in known environments. The manipulator is divided into two sections,
a proximal section that has not entered the space among the obstacles and
a distal section among the obstacles. Harmonic potential functions are employed
to achieve obstacle avoidance for the distal section in three-dimensional
space in order to avoid local minima in cluttered environments. A modified
panel method is used to generate the potential of any arbitrary shaped obstacle
in three-dimensional space. An alternative backbone curve concept and an efficient
fitting method are introduced to control the trajectory of proximal links.
The fitting method is recursive and avoids the complications involved with
solving large systems of nonlinear algebraic equations. The combination of
a three-dimensional safe path derived from the harmonic potential field and
the backbone curve concept leads to an elegant kinematic control strategy
that guarantees obstacle avoidance. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

We propose a combined control system incorporating both a tracking position controller to reduce steady-state error, and a modal-space controller to improve the dynamic properties of the manipulator. To this end, we develop a lumped parameter model for use as a modal-space observer. Simulation results based on a planar two-segment manipulator and experimental results from a single-segment manipulator both show marked improvement using our combined approach.

	abstract = {Compliant joints composed of slit tubes or springs are commonly utilized for steerable endoscopes and catheters. Because this type of joint is actuated by means of its elasticity, it is difficult to bend it with a small radius of curvature. In order to overcome this problem, a hyper-redundant Pulleyless Rolling joint with Elastic Fixtures (PREF joint) is proposed. To enable miniaturization, the PREF joint does not have a pulley, and the rolling contact motion aids the actuation cables to maintain the tension. The elastic fixtures guarantee a stable rolling motion at the center of the rolling surfaces. In this paper, the fundamental characteristics for the unit and the hyper-redundant PREF joints are presented. Moreover, design considerations are proposed for the PREF joint including the rolling tooth shape, structure of the elastic fixtures, and cable actuation method. The validity of the design is verified using finite-element analysis and a 10 mm diameter prototype composed of 12 units of PREF joints for a 1 degree-of-freedom motion. As a result, the 55 mm long joint can be bent up to ±180° with low actuation tension. The presented guidelines will assist in the development of various steerable instruments for medical applications.},

	abstract = {Continuum robotics has rapidly become a rich and diverse area of research, with many designs and applications demonstrated. Despite this diversity in form and purpose, there exists remarkable similarity in the fundamental simplified kinematic models that have been applied to continuum robots. However, this can easily be obscured, especially to a newcomer to the field, by the different applications, coordinate frame choices, and analytical formalisms employed. In this paper we review several modeling approaches in a common frame and notational convention, illustrating that for piecewise constant curvature, they produce identical results. This discussion elucidates what has been articulated in different ways by a number of researchers in the past several years, namely that constant-curvature kinematics can be considered as consisting of two separate submappings: one that is general and applies to all continuum robots, and another that is robot-specific. These mappings are then developed both for the single-section and for the multi-section case. Similarly, we discuss the decomposition of differential kinematics (the robot’s Jacobian) into robot-specific and robot-independent portions. The paper concludes with a perspective on several of the themes of current research that are shaping the future of continuum robotics.},

In this paper a direct and inverse kinetics models are described for a non-constant curvature structure. A major effort has been put recently in modelling and controlling constant curvature structures, such as cylindrical shaped manipulators. Manipulators with non-constant curvature, on the other hand, have been treated with a piecewise constant curvature approximation. In this work a non-constant curvature manipulator with a conical shape is built, taking inspiration from the anatomy of the octopus arm. The choice of a conical shape manipulator made of soft material is justified by its enhanced capability in grasping objects of different sizes. A different approach from the piecewise constant curvature approximation is employed for direct and inverse kinematics model. A continuum geometrically exact approach for direct kinetics model and a Jacobian method for inverse case are proposed. They are validated experimentally with a prototype soft robot arm moving in water. Results show a desired tip position in the task-space can be achieved automatically with a satisfactory degree of accuracy.},

The adaptive computed-torque control algorithm applied to robot manipulators of lumped systems is extended to design the adaptive boundary controller for the coupling system.

Lyapunov stability guarantees the convergence of the tracking error to zero. Finally, the performance of the proposed controller is demonstrated by numerical simulations.},

Recent mechanics-based models of these “active cannulas” are able to accurately describe the curve of the robot in free space, given the preformed tube curves and the linear and angular positions of the tube bases. However, in practical applications, where the active cannula must interact with its environment or apply controlled forces, a model that accounts for deformation under external loading is required. In this paper, we apply geometrically exact rod theory to produce a forward kinematic model that accurately describes large deflections due to a general collection of externally applied point and/or distributed wrench loads. This model accommodates arbitrarily many tubes, with each having a general preshaped curve. It also describes the independent torsional deformation of the individual tubes. Experimental results are provided for both point and distributed loads. Average tip error under load was 2.91 mm (1.5\% - 3\% of total robot length), which is similar to the accuracy of existing free-space models.},

Most prior robots have used tendons routed in straight paths along the robot. However, routing tendons through general curved paths within the robot offers potential advantages in reshaping the workspace and enabling a single section of the robot to achieve a wider variety of desired shapes. In this paper, we provide a new model for the statics and dynamics of robots with general tendon routing paths that is derived by coupling the classical Cosserat-rod and Cosserat-string models. This model also accounts for general external loading conditions and includes traditional axially routed tendons as a special case. The advantage of the usage of this coupled model for straight-tendon robots is that it accounts for the distributed wrenches that tendons apply along the robot. We show that these are necessary to consider when the robot is subjected to out-of-plane external loads. Our experimental results demonstrate that the coupled model matches experimental tip positions with an error of 1.7\% of the robot length, in a set of experiments that include both straight and nonstraight routing cases, with both point and distributed external loads.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a robotic manipulation system capable of autonomously positioning a multi-segment soft fluidic elastomer robot in three dimensions. Specifically, we present an extremely soft robotic manipulator morphology that is composed entirely from low durometer elastomer, powered by pressurized air, and designed to be both modular and durable. To understand the deformation of a single arm segment, we develop and experimentally validate a static deformation model. Then, to kinematically model the multi-segment manipulator, we use a piece-wise constant curvature assumption consistent with more traditional continuum manipulators. In addition, we define a complete fabrication process for this new manipulator and use this process to make multiple functional prototypes. In order to power the robot’s spatial actuation, a high capacity fluidic drive cylinder array is implemented, providing continuously variable, closed-circuit gas delivery. Next, using real-time data from a vision system, we develop a processing and control algorithm that generates realizable kinematic curvature trajectories and controls the manipulator’s configuration along these trajectories. Lastly, we experimentally demonstrate new capabilities offered by this soft fluidic elastomer manipulation system such as entering and advancing through confined three-dimensional environments as well as conforming to goal shape-configurations within a sagittal plane under closed-loop control.},

	abstract = {Snake-like flexible manipulators are widely used in minimally invasive surgery (MIS), which require adequate dexterity in confined workspace. Typically, the design mechanisms of these manipulators include tendon-driven mechanism and concentric tube mechanism. Though, the workspace and dexterity of these designs are limited due to the lack of control in either the length of the bending section or the curvature of the bending section at the distal end. In this paper, we present a novel constrained wire-driven flexible mechanism (CWFM), in which both the length and the curvature of the bending section are controllable. The idea is to employ an active constraint to control the length of the bending section and use the wires to control the curvature of the bending section. Compared to the existing designs based on wire-driven flexible mechanism (WFM), CWFM has expanded workspace and enhanced dexterity while its size is not sacrificed. Additional benefits include much reduced sweeping area and controllable stiffness. Based on the computer simulation, on average, CWFM with the same size as WFM can improve the dexterity by 4.69 times and reduce the sweeping area to 20.5\%.},

However, obstacle interactions impose constraints that conform the robot body into arbitrary shapes regardless of actuator positions. Generally, these effects cannot be wholly sensed on a continuum manipulator and, therefore, render model-based controllers incorrect, leading to artificial singularities and unstable behavior. We present a task-space closed-loop controller for continuum manipulators that does not rely on a model and can be used in constrained environments. Using an optimal control strategy on a tendon-driven robot, we demonstrate this method, which we term model-less control, which allows the manipulator to interact with several constrained environments in a stable manner. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in controlling continuum manipulators without using a model.},

Therefore, a practicable lumped mass model similar to common dynamic models of rigid-link manipulators is needed, which can be used for simulations and model-based control design. The model incorporates mechanical interconnections of parallel and serially connected bellows and uses constant curvature kinematics and its analytical derivatives to balance forces and energies in a global reference frame. The parameters of the resulting model are identified with measurements before the simulation results are experimentally validated.

	abstract = {Traditionally, robot manipulators have been a simple arrangement of a small number of serially connected links and actuated joints. Though these manipulators prove to be very effective for many tasks, they are not without their limitations, due mainly to their lack of maneuverability or total degrees of freedom. Continuum style (i.e., continuous “back-bone”) robots, on the other hand, exhibit a wide range of maneuverability, and can have a large number of degrees of freedom. The motion of continuum style robots is generated through the bending of the robot over a given section; unlike traditional robots where the motion occurs in discrete locations, i.e., joints. The motion of continuum manipulators is often compared to that of biological manipulators such as trunks and tentacles. These continuum style robots can achieve motions that could only be obtainable by a conventionally designed robot with many more degrees of freedom. In this paper we present a detailed formulation and explanation of a novel kinematic model for continuum style robots. The design, construction, and implementation of our continuum style robot called the elephant trunk manipulator is presented. Experimental results are then provided to verify the legitimacy of our model when applied to our physical manipulator. We also provide a set of obstacle avoidance experiments that help to exhibit the practical implementation of both our manipulator and our kinematic model. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Continuum robots exhibit great potential in a number of challenging applications where traditional rigid link robots pose certain limitations, e.g., working in unstructured environments. In order to enable the usage of continuum robots in safety-critical applications, such as surgery and nuclear decontamination, it is extremely important to ensure a safe path for the robot's movement. Existing algorithms for continuum robot path planning have certain limitations that need to be addressed. These include the fact that none of the algorithms provide safety assurance parameters and control for path planning. They are computationally expensive, applicable to a specific type of continuum robots, and mostly they do not incorporate design and kinematics constraints. In this paper, we propose a points-based path planning (PoPP) algorithm for continuum robots that computes the path by imposing safety constraints and improves upon the limitations of existing approaches. In the algorithm, we exploit the constant curvature-bending property of continuum robots in their path planning process. The algorithm is computationally efficient and provides a good tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency that can be implemented to enable the safety-critical application of continuum robots. This algorithm also provides information regarding path volume and flexibility in movement. Simulation results confirm that the algorithm possesses promising potential for all types of continuum robots (following the constant curvature-bending property). We believe that this effectively balances the desired safety and efficiency requirements.},

Therefore, a tip following method is proposed using the sequential quadratic programming optimization approach to navigate the robot. This optimization is used to minimize a set of changes to the arrangement of the snake arm that lets the algorithm follow the desired trajectory with minimal error. The information of the Snake Arm pose is used to limit deviations from the path taken. Therefore, the main objective is to find an efficient objective function that allows uninterrupted movements in real-time. The method proposed is validated through an extensive set of simulations of common arrangements and poses for the snake arm robot. For a 24 DoF robot, the average computation time is 0.4 s, achieving a speed of 4.5 mm/s, with deviation of no more than 25 mm from the ideal path.},

However, a general measure for determining the stability of a given robot configuration has yet to be proposed. In this paper, we use bifurcation and elastic stability theory to provide such a measure, as well as to produce a test for determining whether a given design is snap-free (i.e., whether snapping can occur anywhere in the unloaded robot's workspace).

To overcome intrinsic problems of the methods based on the Jacobian matrix, we propose for the first time a neural network learning the inverse kinetics of the soft manipulator moving in three-dimensional space. After the training, a feed-forward neural network (FNN) is able to represent the relation between the manipulator tip position and the forces applied to the cables. The results show that a desired tip position can be achieved with a degree of accuracy of 1.36\% relative average error with respect to the total arm length.},

Inspired by biological trunks, tentacles, and snakes, continuum robot designs can traverse confined spaces, manipulate objects in complex environments, and conform to curvilinear paths in space. In addition, many designs offer inherent structural compliance and ease of miniaturization. After decades of pioneering research, a host of designs have now been investigated and have demonstrated capabilities beyond the scope of conventional rigid-link robots. Recently, we have seen increasing efforts aimed at leveraging these qualities to improve the frontiers of minimally invasive surgical interventions. Several concepts have now been commercialized, which are inspiring and enabling a current paradigm shift in surgical approaches toward flexible access routes, e.g., through natural orifices such as the nose. In this paper, we provide an overview of the current state of this field from the perspectives of both robotics science and medical applications. We discuss relevant research in design, modeling, control, and sensing for continuum manipulators, and we highlight how this work is being used to build robotic systems for specific surgical procedures. We provide perspective for the future by discussing current limitations, open questions, and challenges.},

In this paper, we present the modeling, sensing and control of multi-backbone continuum robots in a unified framework for hybrid motion/force control. Multi-backbone continuum robots allow to estimate forces and torques at the operational point by monitoring loads along their actuation lines without the need for a dedicated transducer at the operational point. This capability is indeed crucial in emerging fields such as robotic surgery where cost and strict sterilization guidelines prevent the adoption of a dedicated sensor to provide force feedback from the sterile field. To advance further the force sensing capabilities of multi-backbone continuum robots, we present a new framework for hybrid motion and force control of continuum robots with intrinsic force sensing capabilities. The framework is based on a kinetostatic modeling of the multi-backbone continuum robot with, a simplified model for online estimate of the manipulator’s compliance, and a new strategy for merging force and motion control laws in the configuration space of the manipulator. Experimental results show the ability to sense and regulate forces at the operational point and evaluate the framework for shape exploration and stiffness imaging in flexible environments.},

The primary benefit of the proposed method is that the dynamic equations are represented by a set of ODE’s in time instead of PDE’s in time and space, and the new curvature gradient lumped parameter model is used.

Hand-held robots that combine thin manipulators and endoscopes have the potential to address this by integrating seamlessly into the clinical workflow and enhancing dexterity. As a case study illustrating the potential of this approach, we describe a hand-held robotic system that passes two concentric tube manipulators through a 5 mm port in a rigid endoscope for transurethral laser prostate surgery. This system is intended to catalyze the use of a clinically superior, yet rarely attempted, procedure for benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Then, we present a strategy for independently identifying all unknown components of the system: the soft manipulator, its distributed fluidic elastomer actuators, as well as drive cylinders that supply fluid energy. Next, using this model and trajectory optimization techniques we find locally optimal open-loop policies that allow the system to perform dynamic maneuvers we call grabs. In 37 experimental trials with a physical prototype, we successfully perform a grab 92\% of the time. By studying such an extreme example of a soft robot, we can begin to solve hard problems inhibiting the mainstream use of soft machines.},

They have been employed in a variety of applications ranging from search-and-rescue to minimally invasive surgical procedures, and recently they even have been proposed as solutions to problems in maintaining civil infrastructure and the repair of satellites. The kinematic and dynamic properties of snakelike robots are captured naturally using a continuum backbone curve equipped with a naturally evolving set of reference frames, stiffness properties, and mass density. When the snakelike robot has a continuum architecture, the backbone curve corresponds with the physical device itself. Interestingly, these same modeling ideas can be used to describe conformational shapes of DNA molecules and filamentous protein structures in solution and in cells. This paper reviews several classes of snakelike robots: (1) hyper-redundant manipulators guided by backbone curves; (2) flexible steerable needles; and (3) concentric tube continuum robots. It is then shown how the same mathematical modeling methods used in these robotics contexts can be used to model molecules such as DNA. All of these problems are treated in the context of a common mathematical framework based on the differential geometry of curves, continuum mechanics, and variational calculus. Both coordinate-dependent Euler–Lagrange formulations and coordinate-free Euler–Poincaré approaches are reviewed.},

In the case of a catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation, the compliance of the continuum backbone lends an inherent safety to the device. This inherent safety frustrates attempts at precise, accurate, and fast control, limiting the continuum devices to simple and static positioning tasks. This paper develops interleaved continuum-rigid manipulation, by which the hysteretic nonlinearities encountered in tendon-actuated continuum manipulators are compensated by the discrete rigid joints located between the continuum sections. The rigid joints introduce an actuation redundancy, which an interleaved controller may use to avoid the continuum nonlinearities and dynamic excitations, or to prefer particular configurations that may improve task accuracy, permit greater end-effector forces, or avoid environment obstacles. Two experimental systems explore the potential of these joints to: 1) increase the manipulator's dexterous workspace, and 2) correct for actuation nonlinearities and enhance manipulator performance. These experiments also expose important design and control observations that were not apparent in the general robotic and continuum literature.},

Therefore, a dynamic controller in actuator space is developed that both exploits input constraints and decouples the actuators in order to provide a good and intuitive dynamic behavior of the manipulator. Having a pneumatically actuated manipulator with multiple actuators, this can be achieved using a cascaded control approach with a centralized actuator length controller and an underlying decoupled pneumatic controller. For both the outer multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) controller and the inner single-input single-output (SISO) controllers, model-based controllers are developed based on suitable models using feedback linearization and a combination of feedforward control and linear PD-controllers.

They are required to have small size, wide workspace, adequate dexterity and payload ability when operating in confined surgical cavity. Snake-like flexible manipulators are well suited to these applications. However, conventional fully actuated snake-like flexible manipulators are difficult to miniaturize and even after miniaturization the payload is very limited. The alternative is to use underactuated snake-like flexible manipulators. Three prevailing designs are tendon-driven continuum manipulators (TCM), tendon-driven serpentine manipulators (TSM) and concentric tube manipulators (CTM). In this paper, the three designs are compared at the mechanism level from the kinematics point of view. The workspace and distal end dexterity are compared for TCM, TSM and CTM with one, two and three sections, respectively. Other aspects of these designs are also discussed, including sweeping motion, scaling, force sensing, stiffness control, etc. From the results, the tendon-driven designs and concentric tube design complement each other in terms of their workspace, which is influenced by the number of sections as well as the length distribution among sections. The tendon-driven designs entail better distal end dexterity while generate larger sweeping motion in positions close to the shaft.},

	abstract = {Continuum manipulators are a rapidly emerging class of robots. However, due to the complexity of their mathematical models and modeling inaccuracies, the development of effective control systems is a particularly challenging task. This paper presents the first attempt on kinematic control of continuum manipulators using a fuzzy-model-based approach. A fuzzy controller is proposed for autonomous execution of end-effector trajectory tracking tasks for a continuum manipulator. Particularly, membership functions are employed to combine the linearized state-space models, to achieve, overall, a fuzzy model. The fuzzy model can help design the fuzzy controller; in our approach, this process is supported by a thorough stability analysis. This control methodology enables a solution with low computational requirements to this motion control problem - there is no need to continuously update the Jacobian of the continuum manipulator. The superior performance of this controller is validated in MATLAB simulations and compared with those of classical controllers found in the literature. The experiments on a rapid-prototyped continuum manipulator further verify the feasibility and the advantages of this fuzzy controller in the presence of modeling discrepancies and hardware inaccuracies.},

	abstract = {There is a surge of research interest in the field of “continuum robotics.” Robots created under this paradigm offer many advantages and represent unique features in terms of flexibility, dexterity, safety, and weight reduction. This paper introduces a novel continuum manipulator that integrates multiple layers of compliant planar springs-a structure that provides several notable advantages over existing designs. First, it possesses precise linear large-displacement motion. In this context, we utilize the linear output motion of each layer of springs. With the serial connection of multiple conjoined layers, the manipulator demonstrates linear predictable bending even when executing large bends. An analytical method is provided to study the compliance characteristics of the planar spring and derive the compliance matrix to represent the force-deflection relationships, allowing an accurate motion prediction. Second, compared with work elsewhere, this structure demonstrates an effective way of decoupling bending from contraction and expansion. It reduces the uncontrolled compression when generating normal deflections, thus controlling robot bending is simplified. Third, the reachable workspace of the end effector is enlarged by means of varying the length of the continuum manipulator via controlled contraction and expansion. A 3-D printed prototype of this continuum manipulator is experimentally evaluated. The conducted experiments demonstrated validity of our approach.},

First, we develop a dynamic model for a multi-body fluidic elastomer manipulator that is composed entirely from soft rubber and subject to the self-loading effects of gravity. Then, we present a strategy for independently identifying all of the unknown components of the system; these are the soft manipulator, its distributed fluidic elastomer actuators, as well as the drive cylinders that supply fluid energy. Next, using this model and trajectory-optimization techniques we find locally-optimal open-loop policies that allow the system to perform dynamic maneuvers we call grabs. In 37 experimental trials with a physical prototype, we successfully perform a grab 92\% of the time. Last, we introduce the idea of static bracing for a soft elastomer arm and discuss how forming environmental braces might be an effective manipulation strategy for this class of robots. By studying such an extreme example of a soft robot, we can begin to solve hard problems inhibiting the mainstream use of soft machines.},

Meeting these constraints requires implementing a complex mechanical and electrical architecture. Here we present our solution, which involves the construction of sixteen aluminum modules and creation of the Super Servo, a modified hobby servo. To create the Super Servo, we have replaced the electronics in a hobby servo, adding such components as sensors to monitor current and temperature, a communications bus, and a programmable microcontroller. Any robust solution must also protect components from hazardous environments such as sand and brush. To resolve this problem we insert the robots into skins that cover their surface. Functions such as climbing the inside and outside of a pipe add a new dimension of interaction. Thus we attach a compliant, high-friction material to every module, which assists in tasks that require gripping. This combination of the mechanical and electrical architectures results in a robust and versatile robot.},

Equipped with a light and compact motor-encoder actuation mechanism, the new design has improved compliance and possesses a concentric backbone arrangement which is tendon-actuated and spring-loaded. A new forward kinematic model is developed extending the established models for constant-curvature continuum robots, to account for the new design feature of controllable compression (in the hardware).

	abstract = {It is often difficult for orthopedic surgeons to avoid LCL injury during ACL reconstruction. In this paper, we developed a steerable drill for ACL reconstruction to avoid LCL injury in the process of making a bone tunnel. There are two special requirements for the steerable drill mechanism. One is having sufficient flexibility to bend and avoid LCL while cutting the bone. The other is rigidity to avoid the buckle at the base of the drill when external force is exerted on the drill tip. These two requirements cannot be met simultaneously by using the previous material with uniform stiffness throughout its length. We therefore adopted a spring sheath with stiffness that varied between the top and base of the drill. This spring sheath has high stiffness at the base and low stiffness at the top. We performed the experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of the drill with uniform and non-uniform stiffness by comparing each result. Consequently, it was confirmed that the drill with non-uniform stiffness achieved 6 times the bending deformation and with 30\% lower force as preventing the buckling compared to the drill with uniform stiffness. Subsequently, we presented a discussion concerning the reason for the experimental result, based on a physical long column model which simulated the steerable drill. In addition, at the end of this paper, a newly-developed control method to make the arbitrary trajectory of the bone tunnel using a steerable drill with non-uniform stiffness was described.},

Each section is driven by two groups of wires, controlling the bending motion in X and Y directions. This design integrates the serpentine robots' structure and the continuum robots' actuation. As a result, it is more compact than traditional serpentine robots and has a higher positioning accuracy than typical continuum soft robots, such as OctArm V. A Kinematics model and a workspace model of the robot are developed based on the piece wise constant curvature assumption. To evaluate the design, a prototype is built and experiments are carried out. The average distal end positioning error is less than 4\%. Characteristics of the wire-driven robot are also discussed, including the leverage effect and the manipulability under constraint.

	abstract = {Tendon-driven continuum robots offer increased dexterity and manipulability in comparison to conventional rigid link serial manipulators. Being able to conform to complex curves in 3D space, continuum robots are in particular useful for applications in restricted and hardly accessible environments. The workspace of a tendon-driven continuum robot depends on the number of sections, as well as the length of each section and its range of bending radii. Common tendon-driven robot designs have fixed section lengths such that deployment along a tortuous paths requires additional linear translation of the whole robot. In this paper, we propose a novel tendon-driven continuum robot with extensible sections. A telescoping backbone allows control of the section length during operation in addition to bending through tendon actuation. Thus, the arc length of a section can vary and the range of bending radii is enlarged. As a result, the novel robot design inherently allows for deployment along tortuous paths in a follow-the-leader fashion. We suggest the use of spacer disks equipped with permanent magnets with alternating pole orientation. The magnetic repulsion forces enable equidistant spacing of the disks at any lengths of a robot section. We prove the concepts of our novel design with experiments using a first prototype.},

	abstract = {Complex controlled motions, soft human interaction, and minimal moving mass all drive the need for soft robots using fluid filled fiber reinforced elastomer enclosures (FREEs). While a narrow class of FREEs known as McKibben's actuators have been extensively studied, there is a wide unexplored class with complex sets of motion patterns. Combining these actuators in parallel can yield versatile motion patterns resulting in a large overall workspace. Mobility of individual actuators is enforced by inextensibility of fibers and incompressibility of fluids, which in turn drives the net attainable motions. In this paper, we map the mobility of individual FREE actuators to all possible resultant motions that a combination of three sets of actuators arranged in a triangular configuration would undergo. This understanding has resulted in a preliminary design tool that determines individual FREE topologies for a required set of motion patterns. Five case studies that result from this methodology are prototyped and tested for comparison of the predicted and obtained motion directions.},

This is a thorough review of the literature on the nature and development of this device with emphasis on surgical applications. We have reviewed the published literature and classified robotic arms by their application: show, industrial application, medical application, etc. There is a definite trend in the manufacture of robotic arms toward more dextrous devices, more degrees-of-freedom, and capabilities beyond the human arm. da Vinci designed the first sophisticated robotic arm in 1495 with four degrees-of-freedom and an analog on-board controller supplying power and programmability. von Kemplen’s chess-playing automaton left arm was quite sophisticated. Unimate introduced the first industrial robotic arm in 1961, it has subsequently evolved into the PUMA arm. In 1963 the Rancho arm was designed; Minsky’s Tentacle arm appeared in 1968, Scheinman’s Stanford arm in 1969, and MIT’s Silver arm in 1974. Aird became the first cyborg human with a robotic arm in 1993. In 2000 Miguel Nicolalis redefined possible man–machine capacity in his work on cerebral implantation in owl-monkeys directly interfacing with robotic arms both locally and at a distance. The robotic arm is the end-effector of robotic systems and currently is the hallmark feature of the da Vinci Surgical System making its entrance into surgical application. But, despite the potential advantages of this computer-controlled master–slave system, robotic arms have definite limitations. Ongoing work in robotics has many potential solutions to the drawbacks of current robotic surgical systems.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Hyper-redundant, or 'snake-like', manipulators have a very large number of actuatable degrees of freedom. This paper develops an efficient formulation of approximate hyper-redundant manipulator dynamics. The most efficient methods for representing manipulator dynamics in the literature require serial computations proportional to the number of degrees of freedom. Furthermore, these methods are not fully parallelizable. For hyper-redundant manipulators, which may have tens, hundreds or thousands of actuators, these formulations preclude real time implementation. This paper therefore looks at the mechanics of hyper-redundant manipulators from the point of view of an approximation to an 'infinite degree-or-freedom' (or continuum) problem. The dynamics for this case is developed. The approximate dynamics of actual hyper-redundant manipulators is then reduced to a problem which is O(1) in time, i.e. the algorithm is O(n) is the total number of computations, but these computations can be completely distributed over n parallel processors. This is achieved by 'projecting' the dynamics of the continuum model onto the actual robotic structure. Applications of this method to practical computed torque control schemes for hyper-redundant manipulators is demonstrated with two examples: (i) industrial pick-and-place tasks and (ii) inspection in an environment filled with viscous sludge, such as a hazardous waste dump. The results are compared with a lumped mass model of a particular hyper-redundant manipulator.},

The model consists of a finite number of segments, each segment having a specific structure and control. The dynamic behaviour of the arm is obtained using Lagrange's principle developed for infinite-dimensional systems. This model is represented by a set of integral-differential equations. An approximate model is then derived as a set of differential equations with variable coefficients. Two cases are discussed: the sliding mode with the bang-bang control; and the direct mode in which the controller is based on the use of the direct evolution of the system on the switching line by switching the fluid viscosity. The numerical simulations are presented. A nonlinear observer is introduced to estimate the inaccessible state variable distributed on the length of the arm. The conditions which assure the convergence to zero of the errors are proved},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a novel continuum-style robot that integrates multiple layers of compliant modules. Its essential features lie in that its bending is not based on natural compliance of a continuous backbone element or soft skeletal elements but instead is based on the compliance of each structured planar module. This structure provides several important advantages. First, it demonstrates a large linear bending motion, whilst avoiding joint friction. Second, its contraction and bending motion are decoupled. Third, it possesses ideal back-drivability and a low hysteresis. We further provide an analytical method to study the compliance characteristics of the planar module and derive the statics and kinematics of the robot. The paper provides an overview of experiments validating the design and analysis.},

The devices derive bending actuation not from tendon wires or other external mechanisms, but from elastic energy stored in the backbone itself. This allows active cannulas to have a small diameter and a high degree of dexterity, which should enable them to navigate through complex anatomy to sites inaccessible by current surgical robotic devices. Active cannulas may also enhance patient safety because their inherent compliance mitigates potential trauma from inadvertent tool-tissue collision. A consequence of our design is that dexterity improves with miniaturization. A kinematic description of active cannula shape requires a model of the elastic interaction of telescoping pre-curved flexible tubes, and we derive a two-link beam mechanics-based model.

The octopus is a boneless animal and its amazing dexterity is due to its muscular structure where longitudinal (axial), transverse (radial) and oblique muscles seamlessly interact while preserving hydrostaticity i.e. volume conservation (“muscular hydrostat”). Mimicking some features of the octopus is instrumental to design a dexterous and compliant system. After analysing the relevant anatomical and morphological characteristics of the octopus arm, the key biomechanical features of interest to the design of a robotic arm have been identified. A design methodology has been developed based on the analysis of the muscular hydrostat properties. A prototype arm has been built using bespoke contracting pneumatic muscles and expanding elements. In the current stage of development the system has 15 actuated degrees of motion (DOM) and 8 degrees of freedom (DOF), all independently controllable through valves and a dedicated electronics and software interface. Pros and cons of the current design as well as practical prototyping trade-offs are thoroughly described.},

The octopus arm shows peculiar features, such as the ability to bend in all directions, to produce fast elongations, and to vary its stiffness. The octopus achieves these unique motor skills, thanks to its peculiar muscular structure, named muscular hydrostat. Different muscles arranged on orthogonal planes generate an antagonistic action on each other in the muscular hydrostat, which does not change its volume during muscle contractions, and allow bending and elongation of the arm and stiffness variation. By drawing inspiration from natural skills of octopus, and by analysing the geometry and mechanics of the muscular structure of its arm, we propose the design of a robot arm consisting of an artificial muscular hydrostat structure, which is completely soft and compliant, but also able to stiffen. In this paper, we discuss the design criteria of the robotic arm and how this design and the special arrangement of its muscular structure may bring the building of a robotic arm into being, by showing the results obtained by mathematical models and prototypical mock-ups.},

This will enable us to deliver diagnostic as well as therapeutic devices to the target location through the hollow inner core of the cannula. We propose to use SMAs to generate bending forces due to its small size and high power density. We annealed the SMA wires through a customized training process in an arc shape and mounted them at discrete locations on the outer surface of the cannula to enable joint motion. A pulse-width modulation (PWM)-based control scheme was implemented to control all SMA actuators simultaneously to enable multiple joint motion using a single power supply. The proposed controller was validated through an experiment inside gelatin to mimic the motion of the cannula inside a medium which requires a significant amount of force to move the joints of the cannula. Trajectory planning using a suitable metric and trajectory execution were successfully implemented. To demonstrate the delivery of a diagnostic tool through our cannula, we demonstrate that we can pass an optical coherence tomography probe through the cannula and perform in situ microscale imaging.},

This approach is based on a “backbone curve” that captures the robot's macroscopic geometric features.

To efficiently solve the inverse kinematics problem, the authors introduce a “modal” approach, in which a set of intrinsic backbone curve shape functions are restricted to a modal form. The singularities of the modal approach, modal non-degeneracy conditions, and modal switching are considered. For discretely segmented morphologies, the authors introduce “fitting” algorithms that determine the actuator displacements that cause the discrete manipulator to adhere to the backbone curve. These techniques are demonstrated with planar and spatial mechanism examples. They have also been implemented on a 30 degree-of-freedom robot prototype},

The latter named an intervertebra is modeled by three universal-prismatic-spherical and one universal-prismatic joints. The kinematic models of the CBHA are derived from the inverse kinematic equations (IKE) of each intervertebra. A qualitative approach based on neural networks is used to provide approximated solutions of the IKE for real-time implementation. Thus, the combination of the advantages of quantitative and qualitative approaches allows proposing a hybrid methodology for accurate modeling and solving the kinematics of this class of continuum robots. A set of experiments is conducted using a CBHA in order to evaluate the level of efficiency of the proposed hybrid approach.},

This class of robots can be, in most cases, accurately modeled as a chain of cylindrical shapes. In order to safely and seamlessly telemanipulate these robots, which have complex nonintuitive kinematics, haptic guidance schemes have been developed that rely on accurate proximity queries (PQ) to calculate the distance between the continuum robot and the anatomy. This letter introduces an approach to accurately model the continuum robots using cylindrical-shaped segments with spherical or flat caps and then efficiently calculate the shortest distance to a triangle mesh. Implementations of efficient, analytical narrow phase PQ calculations for simple and complex geometrical primitives suitable for parallel computing hardware are presented together with an experimental validation which show improved performance suitable for real-time robotic applications. An in silico experiment comparing various root-finding algorithms, which are commonly used in PQ calculation or other optimization tasks are compared to assess their suitability when executed on different hardware. The implications of these experimental results are discussed, in particular with regards to the selection of a suitable proximity query algorithm depending on the available parallel computing hardware. Finally, an outlook of future improvements for dense dynamic anatomies is presented.},

	abstract = {The prevalence of wire-actuated mechanisms and continuum robots (CRs) for surgical applications stems from several advantages due to the remote location of actuators from the end-effectors (e.g., improved down scalability and sterilization). These advantages, however, come at the expense of inherent uncertainties due to backlash effects, compliance, and friction in the actuation lines, which in turn, limit their precision. In addition, multisegment CRs suffer from actuation coupling, diminishing the accuracy of their kinematic model. This paper aims to address these two gaps by presenting a model-based estimation and actuation compensation framework enabling the online estimation of modeling uncertainties and friction, despite possible temporal changes in these parameters and cross coupling between segments. A capstan friction model accounting for friction-induced actuation line extensions in both fixed and variable geometry conduits is presented. A modified statics model for multisegment robots is presented to account for cross-coupling effects between subsequent CR segments. A sequential estimation approach using the robot inverse kinematics, statics, and measurements of actuated joint positions and forces is then presented. These approaches are then validated experimentally on a two-segment single port access surgery CR.},

An approach for safe exploration implementing hybrid motion/force control is presented on the slave robot side. During exploration, the shape and the local surface normals of the environment are estimated and saved in an exploration data set. The geometric data collected during this exploration scan are used to deform and register the a priori environment model to the exploration data set. The environment registration is achieved using a deformable registration based on the coherent point drift method. The task-description of the high-level assistive telemanipulation law, called a virtual fixture (VF), is then deformed and registered in the new environment. The new model is updated and used within a model-mediated telemanipulation framework. The approach is experimentally validated using a da-Vinci research kit (dVRK) master interface, a dVRK patient side manipulator, and a Cartesian stage robot. Experiments demonstrate that the updated VF and the updated model allow the users to improve their path following performance and to shorten their completion time when the updated path following VF is applied.

	abstract = {Continuum robots are increasingly used in minimally invasive surgeries. To date, the concentric tube mechanism and the cable-driven mechanism have been two prevalent mechanisms for constructing continuum robots. As these two mechanisms complement each other, it is worth exploring the possibility of combining them together. In this paper, we investigate the dexterity of three continuum robots combining both mechanisms. Indices based on the concept of orientability are introduced to analyze the distribution of the dexterity. A Monte Carlo method is used to calculate the dexterity distribution across the workspace. Particularly, directional dexterity indices are put forward to describe the dexterity along different axes. Results imply that evenly allocating degrees of freedom (DOFs) among the segments achieves the best workspace and dexterity. Otherwise, assigning more DOFs to the proximal segment tends to enlarge the workspace and adding more DOFs to the distal segment tends to improve the dexterity. In addition, the dexterity along different axes can vary significantly and thus requires special attention when applying the robot to specific surgical procedures.},

	abstract = {The maintenance works (e.g. inspection, repair) of aero-engines while still attached on the airframes requires a desirable approach since this can significantly shorten both the time and cost of such interventions as the aerospace industry commonly operates based on the generic concept “power by the hour”. However, navigating and performing a multi-axis movement of an end-effector in a very constrained environment such as gas turbine engines is a challenging task. This paper reports on the development of a highly flexible slender (i.e. low diameter-to-length ratios) continuum robot of 25 degrees of freedom capable to uncoil from a drum to provide the feeding motion needed to navigate into crammed environments and then perform, with its last 6 DoF, complex trajectories with a camera equipped machining end-effector for allowing in-situ interventions at a low-pressure compressor of a gas turbine engine. This continuum robot is a compact system and presents a set of innovative mechatronics solutions such as: (i) twin commanding cables to minimise the number of actuators; (ii) twin compliant joints to enable large bending angles (±90°) arranged on a tapered structure (start from 40 mm to 13 mm at its end); (iii) feeding motion provided by a rotating drum for coiling/uncoiling the continuum robot; (iv) machining end-effector equipped with vision system. To be able to achieve the in-situ maintenance tasks, a set of innovative control algorithms to enable the navigation and end-effector path generation have been developed and implemented. Finally, the continuum robot has been tested both for navigation and movement of the end-effector against a specified target within a gas turbine engine mock-up proving that: (i) max. deviations in navigation from the desired path (1000 mm length with bends between 45° and 90°) are ±10 mm; (ii) max. errors in positioning the end-effector against a target situated at the end of navigation path is 1 mm. Thus, this paper presents a compact continuum robot that could be considered as a step forward in providing aero-engine manufacturers with a solution to perform complex tasks in an invasive manner.},

Its joints are arranged as the structure of “Roll-Pitch-Roll-Pitch-....”, where “Roll” and “Pitch” respectively denote a Roll and Pitch joint. Each joint is designed as the same modularized unit, which can be used as a “Roll” or “Pitch” joint. Such design decreases the cost of development and enhances the flexibility of applications. Furthermore, the kinematics equation of this robot is derived and the movement ability is analyzed. Inspired by the biological behavior of a real snake, we plan several typical gaits for the snake-like robot, including peristalsis, rolling and Serpenoid curve gaits. We also develop the embedded controller based on the ARM processor and uc/os-ii real-time operation system. The gait planning algorithms are programmed using C language and realized in the embedded processor. At last, typical cases are experimented.

The new proposed structure of the arm is achieved by a very common and low-cost inflatable material and it is very light, weighing only about 50 g. However, it can realize agile movement by driving six tiny cables installed in the shoulder and elbow joints. The soft inflatable arm can work by pumping air at a very low pressure (\$7.32 {\textbackslash}pm 3.45\$ kPa) and allows direct and soft human contact without any external force sensors. This paper proposes joint compressed models, joint kinematic models, and kinematic models for the whole inflatable robot arm. These models can be easily applied to multijoint arms. In addition, a new redundancy resolution method is also developed for the inflatable arm, which makes it easier to control resolution and is less complex than other traditional approaches. Numerous experiments have been conducted, including performances of accuracy, repeatability, motion trajectories, human-safe interaction, and remote interaction. Results are satisfactory and validate the expected performance of the proposed robotic arm.},

Numerically computed solutions of these models typically satisfy the first-order conditions necessary for equilibrium, but do not provide any information about the elastic stability of the solution. The inability to detect or avoid physically unstable model solutions poses a major hindrance to reliable model-based simulation, planning, design, and control. In this paper, we adapt results from optimal control to determine the stability of Kirchhoff rods and Cosserat rods subject to general end constraints, including coupled multirod models which describe parallel continuum robots. We formulate a sufficient condition for the stability of a solution, a numerical test for evaluating this condition, and a heuristic stability metric. We verify that our numerical stability test agrees with the classical results for the buckling of single columns with various end constraints and for multicolumn frames. We then validate our approach experimentally on a six degree-of-freedom parallel continuum robot.},

	abstract = {Conventionally, joint angles are used as parameters for a spatial chain with spherical joints, where they serve very well for the study of forward kinematics (FK). However, the inverse kinematics (IK) problem is very difficult to solve directly using these angular parameters, on which complex nonlinear loop closure constraints are imposed by required end effector configurations. In a recent paper, our newly developed anchored triangle parameters were presented and shown to be well suited for the study of IK problems in many broad classes of linkages. The focus of that paper was the parameterization of non-singular solutions; among many specific types of IK problems, only one, that of a spatial chain with spherical joints imposing 5 dimensional constraints, was developed in detail. Here we present a unified approach to the solutions of that and two other types of IK problems. The critical concepts in our approach - the geometric formulation in anchored triangle parameters, and the application of loop deformation spaces - are general for all IK problems, and especially useful for redundant systems. For the three IK problems addressed in this paper, we demonstrate convexity properties of the set of IK solutions. We also give detailed descriptions of the parameterization of singular deformations. Similar ideas apply readily to linkages involving multiple loops.},

The purpose of this article is to present a new alternative approach for solving inverse kinematic models for multi-sections of continuum manipulators. To achieve this work, it is assumed that each constitutive section is curved in a circular arc shape with an inextensible central structure axis. At first, the article presents a solution of an inverse kinematic model for one bending section and details some adopted methodologies, based on the identical inverse kinematic model of parallel robots, used for computation of the links’ length. The latter allows concatenating between multiple platforms to realize a bending section. The inverse kinematic model of the multi-section manipulator is then developed using a modular concept where the endpoint coordinates of each bending section are determined using a metaheuristic method. Finally, to validate the proposed approach, some simulation and experimental studies have been carried out on the Compact Bionic Handling Arm. From this investigation, it was found that the multiple test results show the ability of the developed metaheuristic approach to avoid obstacles and to adopt a real-time implementation with multi-section configuration. On the other hand, this type of concept can enable to model all continuum robots with multiple bending sections.},

A tendon-sheath system (TSS) has the advantages of being relatively compact in size, flexible and low cost, and therefore is favoured in building flexible endoscopic robots to pass through long and tortuous human lumen. TSS, however, is prone to nonlinear behaviors such as backlash, hysteresis and direction dependent properties. A compensation technique is required to improve its positioning performance.


Methods

Tension and elongation models of TSS are analyzed. A feedforward motion compensation controller is designed to compensate the asymmetric backlash behavior of the TSS in real time.


Results

Motion tracking experiments were conducted on a TSS driven two DOFs continuum manipulator. The results showed that using the proposed compensation methods, tracking error can be reduced by 74\%.


Conclusions

The proposed compensation method is useful for controlling flexible continuum robots, which are anticipated to have emerging roles in assisting surgeons to perform the increasingly technically challenging endoscopic procedures. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

A kinematic controller, based on the manipulator Jacobian of the proposed rigid-link model, is implemented and realizes trajectory tracking, while using the kinematic redundancy of the manipulator to perform a secondary task of avoiding obstacles. The controller is evaluated on an experimental testbed, consisting of a planar tendon-driven continuum manipulator with two bending segments. Fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors are used to reconstruct 3-D manipulator shape, and is used as feedback for closed-loop control of the manipulator. Manipulator steering is evaluated for two cases: the first case involving steering around a static obstacle and the second case involving steering along a straight path while avoiding a moving obstacle. Mean trajectory tracking errors are 0.24 and 0.09 mm with maximum errors of 1.37 and 0.52 mm for the first and second cases, respectively.

Forward and inverse kinematic (IK) models have been developed to control the last segment of the continuum robot for performing multi-axis processing tasks using the last six Degrees of Freedom (DoF). The forward kinematics (FK) is proposed using a combination of Euler angle representation and homogeneous matrices. Due to the redundancy of the system, different constraints are proposed to solve the IK for different cases; therefore, the IK model is solved for bending and direction angles between (−π/2 to +π/2) radians. In addition, a novel method to calculate the Jacobian matrix is proposed for this type of hyper-redundant kinematics. The error between the results calculated using the proposed Jacobian algorithm and using the partial derivative equations of the FK map (with respect to linear and angular velocity) is evaluated. The error between the two models is found to be insignificant, thus, the Jacobian is validated as a method of calculating the IK for six DoF.},

The bioinspired manipulator has a conical soft structure that confers the ability of twirling around objects as a real octopus arm does. Despite the simple design, the soft conical shape manipulator driven by cables is described by nonlinear differential equations, which are difficult to solve analytically. Since exact solutions of the equations are not available, the Jacobian matrix cannot be calculated analytically and the classical iterative methods cannot be used. To overcome the intrinsic problems of methods based on the Jacobian matrix, this paper proposes a neural network learning the inverse kinematics of a soft octopus-like manipulator driven by cables. After the learning phase, a feed-forward neural network is able to represent the relation between manipulator tip positions and forces applied to the cables. Experimental results show that a desired tip position can be achieved in a short time, since heavy computations are avoided, with a degree of accuracy of 8\% relative average error with respect to the total arm length.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a unique real-time obstacle avoidance approach for manipulators and mobile robots based on the artificial potential field concept. Collision avoidance, tradi tionally considered a high level planning problem, can be effectively distributed between different levels of control, al lowing real-time robot operations in a complex environment. This method has been extended to moving obstacles by using a time-varying artificial patential field. We have applied this obstacle avoidance scheme to robot arm mechanisms and have used a new approach to the general problem of real-time manipulator control. We reformulated the manipulator con trol problem as direct control of manipulator motion in oper ational space—the space in which the task is originally described—rather than as control of the task's corresponding joint space motion obtained only after geometric and kine matic transformation. Outside the obstacles' regions of influ ence, we caused the end effector to move in a straight line with an upper speed limit. The artificial potential field ap proach has been extended to collision avoidance for all ma nipulator links. In addition, a joint space artificial potential field is used to satisfy the manipulator internal joint con straints. This method has been implemented in the COSMOS system for a PUMA 560 robot. Real-time collision avoidance demonstrations on moving obstacles have been performed by using visual sensing.},

	abstract = {During the last decade, sampling-based path planning algorithms, such as probabilistic roadmaps (PRM) and rapidly exploring random trees (RRT), have been shown to work well in practice and possess theoretical guarantees such as probabilistic completeness. However, little effort has been devoted to the formal analysis of the quality of the solution returned by such algorithms, e.g. as a function of the number of samples. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap, by rigorously analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the cost of the solution returned by stochastic sampling-based algorithms as the number of samples increases. A number of negative results are provided, characterizing existing algorithms, e.g. showing that, under mild technical conditions, the cost of the solution returned by broadly used sampling-based algorithms converges almost surely to a non-optimal value. The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of new algorithms, namely, PRM* and RRT*, which are provably asymptotically optimal, i.e. such that the cost of the returned solution converges almost surely to the optimum. Moreover, it is shown that the computational complexity of the new algorithms is within a constant factor of that of their probabilistically complete (but not asymptotically optimal) counterparts. The analysis in this paper hinges on novel connections between stochastic sampling-based path planning algorithms and the theory of random geometric graphs.},

We present a novel motion planning strategy which integrates the sampling-based path planning algorithm with the flexible obstacle avoidance approach for finding the efficient path through changing poses of movable obstacles. Following the resulting path, the manipulator can push the obstacles away and move to the target simultaneously. For dealing with the safety issue of the interaction between manipulator and obstacles, a learning-based motion modeling method is proposed for motion prediction of the obstacles being pushed by manipulator, and then the trained models are utilized in the motion planning. The results from both simulations and real robot experiments show that the proposed method can generate efficient paths which cannot be solved by traditional method.},

This article presents a methodology to control motion planning of a planar space robot with multiple links, that is, hyper-redundant space robot. For control purpose, first a curve-constrained link trajectory tracking control has been developed. Then, the developed control approach has been extended for a collision-free trajectory tracking. For curve-constrained link trajectory tracking control, the backbone reference set (curve fitting) has been applied to exploit the redundancy of two-dimensional space robot of multiple links. For kinematic control purpose, a limited number of joints are actuated. The hyper-redundant space robot has the advantage that manipulator can be configured differently through actuation of different joints. The concept of a limited number of joint actuation has further been extended for collision-free trajectory tracking in the workspace in the presence of obstacles. Collision avoidance is based on the configuration transformation approach where the joints are made active or fixed joint position to facilitate collision-free tip trajectory. Before configuration transformation, collision detection has been performed based on the pseudo-distance criterion. The bond graph technique has been used for the dynamic model of the system and to formulate system equations. The simulation and the animation results validated the successful execution of the proposed approaches for the curve-constrained collision-free trajectory planning.},

Collision-free motion planning of a virtual arm is an intractable task in high-interference environments. In this paper, an approach for collision-free motion planning of a virtual arm based on the forward and backward reaching inverse kinematics (FABRIK) algorithm is proposed. First, a random rotation strategy and local optimum-seeking technology are introduced to improve the FABRIK algorithm in order to avoid obstacles. The improvement FABRIK algorithm is used to design the final grasping posture of a virtual arm according the target position. Then, a bidirectional rapidly exploring random tree (Bi-RRT) algorithm is adopted to explore the process postures from a given initial posture to the final grasping posture. Different from the existing method, the proposed Bi-RRT algorithm in this paper plans the motions of a virtual arm in a seven-dimensional angle space, and the final grasping posture is automatically designed using the obstacle-avoidance FABRIK algorithm instead of the manual design. Finally, the post-processing technique is introduced to remove redundant nodes from the planned motions. This procedure has resolved the problem that the Bi-RRT algorithm is a random algorithm. The experimental results show the proposed method for collision-free motion planning of a virtual arm is feasible.},

Four distinct drawbacks with PFMs are identified. Because of these drawbacks, the authors abandoned potential field methods and developed a new method for fast obstacle avoidance.

	abstract = {A new motion planning method for robots in static workspaces is presented. This method proceeds in two phases: a learning phase and a query phase. In the learning phase, a probabilistic roadmap is constructed and stored as a graph whose nodes correspond to collision-free configurations and whose edges correspond to feasible paths between these configurations. These paths are computed using a simple and fast local planner. In the query phase, any given start and goal configurations of the robot are connected to two nodes of the roadmap; the roadmap is then searched for a path joining these two nodes. The method is general and easy to implement. It can be applied to virtually any type of holonomic robot. It requires selecting certain parameters (e.g., the duration of the learning phase) whose values depend on the scene, that is the robot and its workspace. But these values turn out to be relatively easy to choose, Increased efficiency can also be achieved by tailoring some components of the method (e.g., the local planner) to the considered robots. In this paper the method is applied to planar articulated robots with many degrees of freedom. Experimental results show that path planning can be done in a fraction of a second on a contemporary workstation (≈150 MIPS), after learning for relatively short periods of time (a few dozen seconds)},

	abstract = {This paper presents the first randomized approach to kinodynamic planning (also known                 as trajectory planning or trajectory design). The task is to determine control                 inputs to drive a robot from an ini ial configuration and velocity to a goal                 configuration and velocity while obeying physically based dynamical models and                 avoiding obstacles in the robot’s environment. The authors consider                 generic systems that express the nonlinear dynamics of a robot in terms of the                 robot’s high-dimensional configuration space. Kinodynamic planning is                 treated as a motion-planning problem in a higher dimensional state space that has                 both first-order differential constraints and obstacle-based global constraints. The                 state space serves the same role as the configuration space for basic path planning;                 however, standard randomized path-planning techniques do not directly apply to                 planning trajectories in the state space. The authors have developed a randomized                 planning approach that is particularly tailored to trajectory planning problems in                 high-dimensional state spaces. The basis for this approach is the construction of                 rapidly exploring random trees, which offer benefits that are similar to those                 obtained by successful randomized holonomic planning methods but apply to a much                 broader class of problems.

The planner encodes the motion constraints on the robot with a control system and samples the robot's state × time space by picking control inputs at random and integrating its equations of motion. The result is a probabilistic roadmap of sampled state ×time points, called milestones, connected by short admissible trajectories. The planner does not precompute the roadmap; instead, for each planning query, it generates a new roadmap to connect an initial and a goal state×time point. The paper presents a detailed analysis of the planner's convergence rate. It shows that, if the state×time space satisfies a geometric property called expansiveness, then a slightly idealized version of our implemented planner is guaranteed to find a trajectory when one exists, with probability quickly converging to 1, as the number of milestones increases. Our planner was tested extensively not only in simulated environments, but also on a real robot. In the latter case, a vision module estimates obstacle motions just before planning starts. The planner is then allocated a small, fixed amount of time to compute a trajectory. If a change in the expected motion of the obstacles is detected while the robot executes the planned trajectory, the planner recomputes a trajectory on the fly. Experiments on the real robot led to several extensions of the planner in order to deal with time delays and uncertainties that are inherent to an integrated robotic system interacting with the physical world.},

The kinematics of a steerable needle are non-holonomic and, in two dimensions, equivalent to a Dubins car with constant radius of curvature. In three dimensions, the needle can be interpreted as an airplane with constant speed and pitch rate, zero yaw, and controllable roll angle. We present a constant-time motion planning algorithm for steerable needles based on explicit geometric inverse kinematics similar to the classic Paden— Kahan subproblems. Reachability and path competitivity are analyzed using analytic comparisons with shortest path solutions for the Dubins car (for two dimensions) and numerical simulations (for three dimensions). We also present an algorithm for local path adaptation using null-space results from redundant manipulator theory. Finally, we discuss several ways to use and extend the inverse kinematics solution to generate needle paths that avoid obstacles.},

The focus of this paper lies in the sensor-based position control of the ColoBot for guiding the advancement in a tubular, compliant and slippery environment. The kinematic model related the position of the distal end of the ColoBot to the actuator inputs which is firstly developed and formulated to control the shape of the ColoBot through position control of the distal tip. To achieve safe guidance, the ideal position of the tip should be in the central axis of the colon. A method based on a circumscribed circle is proposed to approximate the central position in real-time based on three sensor readings. This position will be used as reference position for the tip to adjust its shape in real time to avoid the contact with tube wall. This proposed approach can be extended to the control of continuum robots in the conditions of a dynamically confined space. The simulation results and experimental results with a curved tube will be presented in order to validate the proposed control strategy.},

These kinds of manipulators rely on redundancy, making the inverse kinematics very difficult. Therefore, a tip following method is proposed using the sequential quadratic programming optimization approach to navigate the robot. This optimization is used to minimize a set of changes to the arrangement of the snake arm that lets the algorithm follow the desired trajectory with minimal error. The information of the Snake Arm pose is used to limit deviations from the path taken. Therefore, the main objective is to find an efficient objective function that allows uninterrupted movements in real-time. The method proposed is validated through an extensive set of simulations of common arrangements and poses for the snake arm robot. For a 24 DoF robot, the average computation time is 0.4 s, achieving a speed of 4.5 mm/s, with deviation of no more than 25 mm from the ideal path.},

Notice the fact that feasible paths might not be found for any given entry point and target configuration, we also address the feasible entry point planning problem to find feasible entry points in a specified entry zone for any given target configuration. To solve this problem, we developed a motion planning algorithm based on RRTs with backchaining, which grow backward from the target to explore the configuration space. Finally, simulation results with a approximated realistic prostate needle insertion environment demonstrate the performance of the proposed motion planner.},

The RAMP approach enables simultaneous path and trajectory planning and simultaneous planning and execution of motion in real time. It facilitates real-time optimization of trajectories under various optimization criteria, such as minimizing energy and time and maximizing manipulability. It also accommodates partially specified task goals of robots easily. The approach exploits redundancy in redundant robots (such as locomotion versus manipulation in a mobile manipulator) through loose coupling of robot configuration variables to best achieve obstacle avoidance and optimization objectives. The RAMP approach has been implemented and tested in simulation over a diverse set of task environments, including environments with multiple mobile manipulators. The results (and also the accompanying video) show that the RAMP planner, with its high efficiency and flexibility, not only handles a single mobile manipulator well in dynamic environments with various obstacles of unknown motions in addition to static obstacles, but can also readily and effectively plan motions for each mobile manipulator in an environment shared by multiple mobile manipulators and other moving obstacles.},

A suitable path is essential for the robot to reach the target zone while avoiding obstacles, but path planning for continuum robot is a challenge due to their complex kinematics models. To depict the collision free planning problem, a nonlinear, constrained optimization formulation was adopted. Projection strategy was presented and an imaginary straight line between the origin and the target was made up as a reference line to simplify the planning problem. We focused on the decrease of computing time complexity, and based on region clipping, a novel forward search method was proposed to solve this optimization-based planning problem. With the reference straight line, the minimum distance summation (MDS) was calculated to decide the optimal path relatively. Experiments on MATLAB were reasonably designed. Simulations and results analysis demonstrated excellent performance of region clipping search method and feasibility of the avoidance algorithm.},

	abstract = {SUMMARYA continuum manipulator, such as a multisection trunk/tentacle robot, performs manipulation tasks by continuously deforming into different concave shapes. While such a robot is promising for manipulating a wide range of objects in less-structured and cluttered environments, it poses a greater challenge to collision detection than conventional, articulated manipulators. Existing collision detection algorithms are built upon intersection checking between convex primitives, such as between two convex polygons or polyhedra, with the assumption that both the manipulator and the objects in the environment are modeled in terms of those primitives, for example, as polygonal meshes. However, to approximate a continuum manipulator with a polygonal mesh requires a fine mesh because of its concavity, and each time the manipulator changes its configuration by deforming its shape, the mesh has to be updated for the new configuration. This makes mesh-based collision detection involving such a robot much more computationally expensive than that involving an articulated manipulator with rigid links.Hence, we introduce an efficient algorithm for Collision Detection between a Continuum Manipulator (CD-CoM) and its environment based on analytical intersection checking with nonconvex primitives. Our algorithm applies to the exact model of any continuum manipulator consisting of multiple uniform-curvature sections of toroidal and (sometimes) cylindrical shapes as well as more general continuum manipulators whose sections can be approximated by toroidal and cylindrical primitives. Our test results show that using this algorithm is both more accurate and efficient in time and space to detect collisions than approximating a continuum manipulator as a polygonal mesh. Moreover, the CD-CoM algorithm also provides the minimum distance information between the continuum manipulator and objects when there is no collision. Such an efficient algorithm is essential for path/trajectory planning of continuum manipulators in real-time.},

In this paper, we demonstrated a two-dimensional mechanical model for a tendon actuated, notched DCM with compliant joints. The model predicted deformation of the DCM accurately in the presence of tendon force, friction force, and external force. A partition approach was proposed to describe the DCM as a series of interconnected rigid and flexible links. Beam mechanics, taking into consideration tendon interaction and external force on the tip and the body, was applied to obtain the deformation of each flexible link of the DCM. The model results were compared with experiments for free bending as well as bending in the presence of external forces acting at either the tip or body of the DCM. The overall mean error of tip position between model predictions and all of the experimental results was 0.62 ± 0.41 mm.

	abstract = {The recent decade has seen an astounding increase of interest and advancement in a new field of robotics, aimed at creating structures specifically for the safe interaction with humans. Softness, flexibility, and variable stiffness in robotics have been recognized as highly desirable characteristics for many applications. A number of solutions were proposed ranging from entirely soft robots (such as those composed mainly from soft materials such as silicone), via flexible continuum and snake-like robots, to rigid-link robots enhanced by joints that exhibit an elastic behavior either implemented in hardware or achieved purely by means of intelligent control. Although these are very good solutions paving the path to safe human–robot interaction, we propose here a new approach that focuses on creating stiffness controllability for the linkages between the robot joints. This article proposes a replacement for the traditionally rigid robot link—the new link is equipped with an additional capability of stiffness controllability. With this added feature, a robot can accurately carry out manipulation tasks (high stiffness), but can virtually instantaneously reduce its stiffness when a human is nearby or in contact with the robot. The key point of the invention described here is a robot link made of an airtight chamber formed by a soft and flexible, but high-strain resistant combination of a plastic mesh and silicone wall. Inflated with air to a high pressure, the mesh silicone chamber behaves like a rigid link; reducing the air pressure, softens the link and rendering the robot structure safe. This article investigates a number of link prototypes and shows the feasibility of the new concept. Stiffness tests have been performed, showing that a significant level of stiffness can be achieved—up to 40 N reaction force along the axial direction, for a 25-mm-diameter sample at 60 kPa, at an axial deformation of 5 mm. The results confirm that this novel concept to linkages for robot manipulators exhibits the beam-like behavior of traditional rigid links when fully pressurized and significantly reduced stiffness at low pressure. The proposed concept has the potential to easily create safe robots, augmenting traditional robot designs.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a novel constrained tendon-driven serpentine manipulator (CTSM) suited for minimally invasive surgery is presented. It comprises of a flexible backbone, a set of controlling tendons and a constraint. In the CTSM not only the curvature of the bending section can be controlled but also the length. Specifically, the curvature is controlled by the tendons, and the length is controlled by a constraint tube, which is translational and is concentric with the flexible backbone. The kinematic model of the CTSM is developed based on the piecewise constant curvature assumption. Analysis shows that by introducing the translational constraint both the workspace and dexterity of the manipulator are improved. The stiffer the constraint the larger the workspace expansion and the smaller the dexterity enhancement. A prototype is developed and the experimental results validate the design idea and analysis.},

In this paper a path planning and obstacle avoidance algorithm for multisection continuum arms in dynamic environments is presented. This work is potentially applicable to surgical procedures to navigate near vital organs and reach surgical targets without injuring surrounding tissues. On the macro scale it can snake a continuum arm through constrained spaces such as inside of tubes for search and rescue purposes. Simulation results are presented for obstacle avoidance in static and dynamic environments. The algorithm utilizes a mode shape function based kinematic model of continuum arms and yields accurate solutions efficiently.

Design of these robots requires specification of a stiff yet bendable backbone, selection of cable support heights and spacings, and development of a cable drive system. The robot arm divides into sections that are subdivided into segments bounded by cable supports. Cable pairs attach to the end of each section and provide two axis bending. Thus, with many sections, the arm can be bent into complex shapes to allow redundant positioning of the end effector payload. The kinematics of the entire arm are determined from the segment kinematics. This paper derives and numerically solves the nonlinear kinematics for a single segment of a continuous backbone robot. Optimal spacing of the cable supports maximizes displacement, load capacity, and simplicity of the robot kinematics. An experimental system verifies the theoretically predicted performance.},

To efficiently solve the inverse kinematics problem, the authors introduce a “modal” approach, in which a set of intrinsic backbone curve shape functions are restricted to a modal form. The singularities of the modal approach, modal non-degeneracy conditions, and modal switching are considered. For discretely segmented morphologies, the authors introduce “fitting” algorithms that determine the actuator displacements that cause the discrete manipulator to adhere to the backbone curve.

Despite these significant advantages, however, most PKM designs, typically, yield limited workspace, problematic singularities, and configuration-dependent stiffness. In response, mechanism redundancy has emerged as an effective tool to address these and other problems. In this paper, we present an in-depth discussion of past research on PKM redundancy. The methodical review of the pertinent literature, first, introduces the concept of redundancy based on the number of actuators and the number of degrees of freedom required to perform a task and, then, discusses the two main types of redundancy according to the mobility of the mechanism, i.e., kinematic and actuation redundancy. Subsequently, research on the design aspects of redundant PKMs, including the various criteria used for design optimization is detailed. Primary advantages of PKM redundancy include workspace enlargement, singularity elimination/ avoidance, and improved joint-torque distribution. In this paper, these advantages are discussed in contrast to the main challenges redundant mechanisms present, such as in motion planning and control, and calibration. Other issues of PKM redundancy, briefly, presented herein for completeness are fault-tolerance, reconfigurability, cable-driven and hyper-redundant PKMs.},

The calculus of variations is used to develop differential equations, whose solution is the optimal backbone curve shape. We show that this approach is computationally efficient on a single processor, and generates solutions in O(1) time for an N degree-of-freedom manipulator when implemented in parallel on O(N) processors. For this reason, it is better suited to hyper-redundant robots than other redundancy resolution methods.

The design of this snake-like unit is compared to other alternative designs that use a single flexible-backbone and wire-actuation. A unified kinematic and virtual work model is used to perform this comparison between a multi-backbone snake like unit with an equal-diameter snake-like unit using a single flexible backbone and wire actuation. The comparison is presented for several actuation redundancy resolutions that minimize the load on the flexible backbones. The results show that the multi-backbone design is superior to the alternative wire-actuated designs using a single flexible backbone. The advantages manifest in smaller required actuation forces on the backbones and, as a result, a reduced risk of buckling of the backbones and enhanced potential downsize scalability.},

Furthermore, shape computation based on kinematic input variables can be inaccurate due to parameter errors and model simplification. An alternate approach is to compute the shape in real-time from a set of sensors positioned along the length of the robot that provide measurements of local curvature, e.g., optical fiber Bragg gratings. This paper proposes a general framework for selecting the number and placement of such sensors with respect to arclength so as to compute the forward kinematic solution accurately and quickly. The approach is based on defining numerically-efficient shape reconstruction models parameterized by sensor number and location. Optimization techniques are used to find the sensor locations that minimize shape and tip error between a reconstruction model and a mechanics-based model. As a specific example, several reconstruction models are proposed and compared for concentric tube robots. These results indicate that the choice of reconstruction model as well as sensor placement can have a substantial effect on robot shape estimation.},

Each of the segments is modular, containing a set of actuation motors that drive short cables in the continuum segments.

The implementation for the mechanical, electrical, and software design is described and the robotic endoscope bending motions are sensed, simulated and controlled using kinematic models.

In the process of transporting the object, a simplified desired shape is generated from a Bézier curve according to a given goal position and the arm geometry.

We present two methods to find all the possible conformations of short six degree-of-freedom segments of biopolymers which satisfy end constraints in position and orientation. One of our methods is motivated by inverse kinematic solution techniques which have been developed for “general” 6R serial robotic manipulators. However, conventional robot kinematics methods are not directly applicable to the geometry of polymers, which can be treated as a degenerate case where all the “link lengths” are zero. Here, we propose a method which extends the elimination method of Kohli and Osvatic. This method can be applied directly to the geometry of biopolymers. We also propose a heuristic method based on a Lie-group-theoretic description. In this method, we utilize inverse iterations of the Jacobian matrix to obtain all conformations which satisfy end constraints. This can be easily implemented for both the general 6R manipulator and polymers. Although the extended elimination method is computationally faster than the Jacobian method, in cases where some of the joint angles are 180° (i.e., where the elimination method fails), we combine these two methods effectively to obtain the full set of inverse kinematic solutions. We demonstrate our approach with several numerical examples.},

	abstract = {Redundant mechanical systems like humanoid robots are designed to fulfill multiple tasks at a time. A task, in velocity-resolved inverse kinematics, is a desired value for a function of the robot configuration that can be regulated with an ordinary differential equation (ODE). When facing simultaneous tasks, the corresponding equations can be grouped in a single system or, better, sorted in priority and solved each in the solutions set of higher priority tasks. This elegant framework for hierarchical task regulation has been implemented as a sequence of least-squares problems. Its limitation lies in the handling of inequality constraints, which are usually transformed into more restrictive equality constraints through potential fields. In this paper, we propose a new prioritized task-regulation framework based on a sequence of quadratic programs (QP) that removes the limitation. At the basis of the proposed algorithm, there is a study of the optimal sets resulting from the sequence of QPs. The algorithm is implemented and illustrated in simulation on the humanoid robot HRP-2.},

	abstract = {A hyper-redundant space manipulator has extreme flexibility and is suitable to work in highly cluttered or multi-obstacles environment. However, its inverse kinematics is very challenging due to a large number of degrees of freedom (DOFs). In this paper, a modified modal method is proposed to solve the mission-oriented inverse kinematics. The spatial backbone of the manipulator is defined using a mode function, according to the mission requirement and working environment. All the universal joints are divided into M/2 groups, i.e. two adjacent universal joints comprise a group (M is the number of universal joints; it is assumed an even number. If it is an odd number, the remaining universal joint is a separated group). The whole manipulator is then segmented into M/2 sub-manipulators. Each sub-manipulator has 4-DOFs and is redundant for position or orientation. The last sub-manipulator is used to match the desired direction vector and the position of the end-effector with respect to the previous sub-manipulator's end. The remaining sub-manipulators are used to control the relative position between each other with one redundant degree of freedom. The equivalent link is fitted to the backbone function. The Cartesian coordinates of each node is then determined by combining the total length of the manipulator and the mode function. Then, the joint angles are solved through the position of each node. For each 4-DOF group, a parameter called arm angle is used to denote the redundancy and optimize its local configuration. Finally, typical cases of a 12-DOF and a 20-DOF manipulators are simulated. The results show that the method is very efficient for resolving the inverse kinematics of hyper-redundant space manipulators.},

We introduce a method for efficiently computing stable configurations of a wire subject to manipulation constraints. These configurations correspond to minimal-energy curves. By restricting the planner to minimal-energy curves, the execution of a path becomes easier. Our curve representation is adaptive in the sense that the number of parameters automatically varies with the complexity of the underlying curve. We introduce a planner that computes paths from one minimal-energy curve to another such that all intermediate curves are also minimal-energy curves. This planner can be used as a powerful local planner in a sampling-based roadmap method. This makes it possible to compute a roadmap of the entire "shape space," which is not possible with previous approaches. Using a simplified model for obstacles, we can find minimal-energy curves of fixed length that pass through specified tangents at given control points.

	abstract = {This paper provides a theoretical framework for controlling a manipulator with hyper                 degrees of freedom (HDOF). An HDOF manipulator has the capability to achieve various                 kinds of tasks. To make full use of its capability, shape control is proposed here;                 that is, not only the tip of a manipulator, but also its whole body is controlled.                 To formulate control objectives for shape control, we define a shape correspondence                 between an HDOF manipulator and a spatial curve that prescribes a desired shape. The                 shape correspondence is defined by using solutions of a nonlinear optimization                 problem termed the shape-inverse problem. We give theorems on the existence of the                 solutions, and on an existence region that allows us to convert shape-control                 problems into more tractable ones. A shape-regulation control problem is considered                 first to bring an HDOF manipulator onto a given time-invariant curve. The idea of                 estimating the desired curve parameters is the crucial key to solving the problem by                 Lyapunov design. The derived shape-regulation law includes the estimator, which                 infers the desired curve parameters corresponding to the desired joint positions on                 the curve. The idea of the desired curve-parameter estimation is also effective for                 shape tracking where a time-varying curve is used for prescribing a moving desired                 shape. Considering an estimator with second-order dynamics enables us to find two                 shape-tracking control laws by utilizing conventional tracking methods in                 manipulator control. We show the simulation results of applying the derived                 shape-tracking control laws to a 20-DOF manipulator.},

Each bending section can be controlled independently to deform as an arc with different curvatures. This method is based on the positional and the directional information of limited specific joints on the robot, which can be estimated with an effective positioning method, such as electromagnetic tracking method. The number and the position of these specific joints are only determined by the number of sections. Based on the positional and the directional information, as well as the curve length information, the shape reconstruction algorithm can be carried out by fitting multiple quadratic Bézier curves.

Thirdly, a gripper module is designed based on the combination of the cell units in one end. Fourthly, several body modules and a gripper module are serially linked to form a soft robot. Fifthly, the basic kinematics of the module is modeled and analyzed. Finally, a prototype made up of silicone rubber is developed for experiments. In the experiments, the soft robot managed to pick up a ball and an egg. The quantitative experiments show that the maximum bending angle was about 90°, and the maximum extending ratio approaches 1.7:1 for a three-module robot test. Reliability test shows a good behavior even though the robot lost its 50\% cells.

Tendon actuation is one of the most popular approaches, which is to insert the tendon to eccentrically go through and interact with the flexible backbone to accomplish compliant bends. However, hysteresis of tip trajectory of tendon actuated dexterous manipulators (TA–DMs) has been observed during the loading and unloading procedure, which is mainly caused by the hindered friction at discrete interactions between the actuation tendon and conduits. This paper aims to propose a general friction model to describe the interactions and friction profile at the multiple discrete contact points for tendon actuated dexterous manipulators under the history-dependent tendon tension. The friction model was integrated into the beam theory to describe the hysteresis and loading history-dependent behavior by solving the profiles of tendon force, normal force, and friction force, as well as the deflection of the dexterous manipulator. Experiments were carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed friction model. Results indicate that the friction model can successfully describe the discrete interaction and predict the deflection of dexterous manipulator subject to the different tendon loading histories. Furthermore, the effects of discrete friction to the tendon force propagation and the loading history-dependent behavior are discussed.},

	abstract = {It is important to enable a robot to manipulate a target object that has no 3-D model information and is situated in an environment with other unknown objects nearby. This poses an open problem of how to combine perception and manipulation to enable the robot to build an appearance-based model of the target object on the spot to facilitate further manipulation of the object while avoiding the other unknown obstacles in the way. In this paper, we introduce an approach to enable a continuum manipulator, which is apt to maneuver through a crowded environment, to gradually build a 3-D surface model of the target object by moving an RGB-D sensor around the object while also detecting and avoiding surrounding unknown obstacles. Our approach interleaves perception and manipulation such that perception guides the manipulator movement, which in turn allows more perception of the target object for object model building and further manipulator motion. Our approach is characterized by a progressive strategy to register RGB-D images of the target object to build and extend a partial model of the object and the corresponding motion planning strategy for the continuum robot to carry out model building and avoid obstacles at the same time. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, experiments on progressive model building of real objects from real RGB-D images are conducted, where a simulated continuum robot plans and executes its motion to carry the RGB-D camera around a target object for taking those images in an augmented reality setting.},

By design, parallel continuum robots exhibit large, nonlinear deformations in their legs to achieve multi-DOF end effector articulation, but excess leg bowing can limit their reachable workspace, especially for long slender designs. In this paper, we investigate a parallel continuum robot design with a passive spring backbone carrying disks that constrain the legs at intermediate points. The constraints route the legs in helical paths around the backbone and prevent large divergence of the legs, expanding the reachable workspace for slender form factors while preserving the manipulator's six degrees of freedom. We present a novel forward and inverse kinematics model, based on Cosserat rod theory, that accommodates general leg routing paths and any number of intermediate constraint disks. We also explore manipulator workspace with experiments and simulations, demonstrating that intermediate constraints expand the reachable workspace of slender parallel continuum robots.},

	abstract = {Continuum manipulators possess the ability to travel on nonlinear paths and avoid obstacles in confined environments. A variety of designs were proposed for several applications, such as minimally invasive surgery or inspections and maintenance in hazardous spaces. While hyperredundant robots can follow a path on the large scale, path following behavior on small the scale is still a challenge. Only a limited number of paths can be followed by small continuum robots due to design constraints such as fixed curvatures or fixed segment lengths. For most applications, continuum robot parameters have to be optimized and selected according to specific task and design constraints. This is time consuming and limits the utilization of the manipulator to specific application scenarios. In this work, we propose a hybrid continuum robot design to overcome these disadvantages and offer a universal tool which is able to follow any constant curvature path. The design is comprised of a telescopic composition of several tendon driven patterned elastic tubes. Each one can be translated and bent independently. With this design we achieve improved path deviation errors (max 0.6 mm) in comparison to previously proposed continuum robots in simulation. We prove the path following behavior on random paths with a two segment prototype robot with overall outer diameter of 6 mm in an experimental setup with average path deviation errors lower than 5 mm.},

Its joints are arranged as the structure of “Roll-Pitch-Roll-Pitch-....”, where “Roll” and “Pitch” respectively denote a Roll and Pitch joint. Each joint is designed as the same modularized unit, which can be used as a “Roll” or “Pitch” joint. Such design decreases the cost of development and enhances the flexibility of applications. Furthermore, the kinematics equation of this robot is derived and the movement ability is analyzed. Inspired by the biological behavior of a real snake, we plan several typical gaits for the snake-like robot, including peristalsis, rolling and Serpenoid curve gaits. We also develop the embedded controller based on the ARM processor and uc/os-ii real-time operation system. The gait planning algorithms are programmed using C language and realized in the embedded processor. At last, typical cases are experimented.

	abstract = {A new class of robotic arm consists of a periodic sequence of truss substructures, each of which has several variable-length members. Such variable-geometry truss manipulators (VGTMs) are inherently highly redundant and promise a significant increase in dexterity over conventional anthropomorphic manipulators. This dexterity may be exploited for both obstacle avoidance and controlled deployment in complex workspaces. The inverse kinematics problem for such unorthodox manipulators, however, becomes complex because of the large number of degrees of freedom, and conventional solutions to the inverse kinematics problem become inefficient because of the high degree of redundancy. This paper presents a solution to this problem based on a spline-like reference curve for the manipulator's shape. Such an approach has a number of advantages: (1) direct, intuitive manipulation of shape; (2) reduced calculation time; and (3) direct control over the effective degree of redundancy of the manipulator. Furthermore, although the algorithm has been developed primarily for variable-geometry-truss manipulators, it is general enough for application to other manipulator designs.},

The approach presented here is to determine the re quired joint angle rates for the manipulator under the con straints of multiple goals, the primary goal described by the specified end-effector trajectory and secondary goals describ ing the obstacle avoidance criteria. The decomposition of the solution into a particular and a homogeneous component effectively illustrates the priority of the multiple goals that is exact end-effector control with redundant degrees of freedom maximizing the distance to obstacles.

	abstract = {Concentric tube robots are thin, tentacle-like devices that can move along curved paths and can potentially enable new, less invasive surgical procedures. Safe and effective operation of this type of robot requires that the robot's shaft avoid sensitive anatomical structures (e.g., critical vessels and organs) while the surgeon teleoperates the robot's tip. However, the robot's unintuitive kinematics makes it difficult for a human user to manually ensure obstacle avoidance along the entire tentacle-like shape of the robot's shaft. We present a motion planning approach for concentric tube robot teleoperation that enables the robot to interactively maneuver its tip to points selected by a user while automatically avoiding obstacles along its shaft. We achieve automatic collision avoidance by precomputing a roadmap of collision-free robot configurations based on a description of the anatomical obstacles, which are attainable via volumetric medical imaging. We also mitigate the effects of kinematic modeling error in reaching the goal positions by adjusting motions based on robot tip position sensing. We evaluate our motion planner on a teleoperated concentric tube robot and demonstrate its obstacle avoidance and accuracy in environments with tubular obstacles.},

Given an object, a continuum manipulator tries to grasp it by wrapping tightly around it. Autonomous grasping requires realtime determination of whether an object can be grasped after it is identified, and if so, the feasible whole-arm wrapping around configurations of the robot to grasp it, which we call grasping configurations, as well as the path leading to a grasping configuration. In this paper, we describe the process for autonomous grasping from object detection to executing the grasping motion and achieving force-closure grasps, with a focus on a general analysis of all possible types of planar grasping configurations of a three-section continuum manipulator. We further provide conditions for existence of solutions and describe how to find a valid grasping configuration and the associated path automatically if one exists. Experimental results with the OctArm manipulator validate our approach, and shows that the entire process to determine an autonomous grasping operation, which includes automatic detection of the target object and determination of a grasping configuration and a path to the grasping configuration that avoids obstacles, can take just a small fraction of a second. Once a grasping configuration is reached, the manipulator can lift the object stably, i.e., a force-closure grasp can be achieved.},

Planning motions for these devices is challenging in part due to their complex kinematics; concentric tube robots are composed of thin, pre-curved, telescoping tubes that can achieve a variety of shapes via extension and rotation of each of their constituent tubes. We introduce a new motion planner to maneuver these devices to clinical targets while minimizing the probability of colliding with anatomical obstacles. Unlike prior planners for these devices, we more accurately model device shape using mechanics-based models that consider torsional interaction between the tubes. We also account for the effects of uncertainty in actuation and predicted device shape. We integrate these models with a sampling-based approach based on the Rapidly-Exploring Roadmap to guarantee finding optimal plans as computation time is allowed to increase. We demonstrate our motion planner in simulation using a variety of evaluation scenarios including an anatomy-based neurosurgery case that requires maneuvering to a difficult-to-reach brain tumor at the skull base.},

Each coil is modelled using finite element data adjusted by measurement-based correction, (a maximum observed mean error between the model and the prediction of 3.36 ± 5.62\%). The model for a full system is validated in two tasks. In the first task, the system executes a prescribed rotating field (mean error between the model and measurement of 7.51\% and minimum R2 of 0.964). The second task tests the estimation of the field for known 3D trajectories (minimum R2 of 0.967).

The catheter is directly actuated by magnetic torques generated on a set of current-carrying microcoils embedded on the catheter tip by the magnetic field of the MRI scanner. The Jacobian matrix relating changes of the currents through the coils to changes of the tip position is derived using a three-dimensional kinematic model of the catheter deflection. The inverse kinematics is numerically computed by iteratively applying the inverse of the Jacobian matrix. The damped least square method is implemented to avoid numerical instability issues that exist during the computation of the inverse of the Jacobian matrix. The performance of the proposed inverse kinematics approach is validated using a prototype of the robotic catheter by comparing the actual trajectories of the catheter tip obtained via open-loop control with the desired trajectories. The results of reproducibility and accuracy evaluations demonstrate that the proposed Jacobian-based inverse kinematics method can be used to actuate the catheter in an open loop to successfully perform complex ablation trajectories required in atrial fibrillation ablation procedures. This study paves the way for effective and accurate closed-loop control of the robotic catheter with real-time feedback from MRI guidance in subsequent research.},

A hyper-redundant manipulator is made by mounting the serial and/or parallel mechanisms on top of each other as modules. In discrete actuation, the actuation amounts are a limited number of certain values. It is not feasible to solve the kinematic analysis problems of discretely actuated hyper-redundant manipulators (DAHMs) by using the common methods, which are used for continuous actuated manipulators. In this paper, a new method is proposed to solve the trajectory tracking problem in a static prescribed obstacle field. To date, this problem has not been considered in the literature. The removing first collision (RFC) method, which is originally proposed for solving the inverse kinematic problems in the obstacle fields was modified and used to solve the motion planning problem. For verification, the numerical results of the proposed method were compared with the results of the genetic algorithm (GA) method. Furthermore, a novel DAHM designed and implemented by the authors is introduced.},

To simulate the motion of such an object, one strategy is to discretize the object into large number of small rigid links connected by joints. However, the resulting discretised system is highly redundant and the joint rotations for a desired Cartesian motion of any point on the object cannot be solved uniquely. In this paper, we revisit an algorithm, based on the classical tractrix curve, to resolve the redundancy in such hyper-redundant systems. For a desired motion of the ‘head’ of a link, the ‘tail’ is moved along a tractrix, and recursively all links of the discretised objects are moved along different tractrix curves. The algorithm is illustrated by simulations of a moving snake, tying of knots with a rope and a solution of the inverse kinematics of a planar hyper-redundant manipulator. The simulations show that the tractrix based algorithm leads to a more ‘natural’ motion since the motion is distributed uniformly along the entire object with the displacements diminishing from the ‘head’ to the ‘tail’.},

Moreover, when the motion or disturbance at one end gradually dies down along the curve defining the one-dimensional flexible objects, the motion appears “natural”. This paper presents a purely geometric and kinematic approach for deriving more natural and length-preserving transformations of planar and spatial curves. Techniques from variational calculus are used to determine analytical conditions and it is shown that the velocity at any point on the curve must be along the tangent at that point for preserving the length and to yield the feature of diminishing motion. It is shown that for the special case of a straight line, the analytical conditions lead to the classical tractrix curve solution. Since analytical solutions exist for a tractrix curve, the motion of a piecewise linear curve can be solved in closed-form and thus can be applied for the resolution of redundancy in hyper-redundant robots. Simulation results for several planar and spatial curves and various input motions of one end are used to illustrate the features of motion damping and eventual alignment with the perturbation vector.},

In this paper, we compare three known methods and show that an algorithm based on a classical curve, called the tractrix, leads to a more “natural” motion of the hyper-redundant robot with the displacements diminishing from the end-effector to the fixed base. In addition, since the actuators nearer the base “see” a greater inertia due to the links farther away, smaller motion of the actuators nearer the base results in better motion of the end-effector as compared with other two approaches.

	abstract = {A multi-pass sequential localized search technique to solve the problem of path planning of hyper-redundant manipulators for the shortest path in real-time in the presence of obstacles is proposed. The problem is approached from a control perspective as a shortest path optimal control problem, where the configuration space is searched for path points that optimize a cost function. This method addresses the “curse of dimensionality” of exhaustive search techniques via a multi-pass sequential localized search, and sensitivity to local minima of greedy approaches via a backtracking technique. Further, theoretical proof shows that the proposed technique converges to a global optimal (if only one exists) or a suboptimal (if many exist) solution. The algorithm is implemented on a 6-DOF PUMA 560 and a 9-DOF hyper-redundant manipulator arm and simulation results are analyzed for cost and time of execution.},

	abstract = {A Cable-driven Snake-like Robot (CSR) with a flexible backbone possesses a number of promising advantages over the conventional rigid-link manipulators, such as lightweight mechanical structure, large reachable workspace, high dexterity, and high maneuverability. In general, a CSR is a hyper-redundant manipulator that consists of a large number of identical or similar segments. A modular design approach is employed in this paper in order to simplify the CSR design, analysis, and control to a manageable level. As the basic building block of CSRs, a 2-DOF cable-driven joint module with a flexible backbone is proposed. Based on the motion characteristics of the 2-DOF joint module, the concept of instantaneous rotation axis in conjunction with the Product-Of-Exponentials (POE) formula is proposed to formulate its kinematic model. However, as the instantaneous rotation axis is unfixed, the Lie Bracket method from the Group theory is employed to derive the instantaneous kinematic model of the joint module. With the joint's kinematics model, a configuration-independent numerical inverse kinematics (NIK) algorithm is formulated for the modular CSRs. The effectiveness of the proposed NIK algorithm is validated through simulation examples.},

We designed a novel motor learning algorithm based on cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning that enables high-dimensional manipulators to exploit an abstracted state-space through a reward-guided mechanism to find solutions that have a guaranteed precision. We test our algorithm on a simulated planar 6-DOF with a discrete action-set and show that the all the points reached by the manipulator average an accuracy of 0.0056m (±0.002). The algorithm was found to be repeatable. We further validated our concept on the Baxter robotic arm to generate solutions up to 0.008m, exceptions being the joint angle accuracy and calibration of the robot.},

	abstract = {The Perspective-Three-Point (P3P) problem aims at determining the position and orientation of the camera in the world reference frame from three 2D-3D point correspondences. This problem is known to provide up to four solutions that can then be disambiguated using a fourth point. All existing solutions attempt to first solve for the position of the points in the camera reference frame, and then compute the position and orientation of the camera in the world frame, which alignes the two point sets. In contrast, in this paper we propose a novel closed-form solution to the P3P problem, which computes the aligning transformation directly in a single stage, without the intermediate derivation of the points in the camera frame. This is made possible by introducing intermediate camera and world reference frames, and expressing their relative position and orientation using only two parameters. The projection of a world point into the parametrized camera pose then leads to two conditions and finally a quartic equation for finding up to four solutions for the parameter pair. A subsequent backsubstitution directly leads to the corresponding camera poses with respect to the world reference frame. We show that the proposed algorithm offers accuracy and precision comparable to a popular, standard, state-of-the-art approach but at much lower computational cost (15 times faster). Furthermore, it provides improved numerical stability and is less affected by degenerate configurations of the selected world points. The superior computational efficiency is particularly suitable for any RANSAC-outlier-rejection step, which is always recommended before applying PnP or non-linear optimization of the final solution.},

There are two key features in our approach: 1) a paradigm for switching between simple decentralized controllers that allows for changes in formation; 2) the use of information from a single type of sensor, an omnidirectional camera, for all our controllers. We describe estimators that abstract the sensory information at different levels, enabling both decentralized and centralized cooperative control.

	abstract = {Abstract — Inverse kinematics solutions of a reconfigurabie robot system built upon a collection of standardized components is dificult to obtain because of its varying configuration. This paper addresses the formulation of a generic numerical inverse kinematics model and automatic generation of the model for arbitrary robot geometry including serial type and branching type geometry. Both revolute and prismatic types of joints are considered. The inverse kinematics is obtained through the di@erential kinematics equations based on the Productof-exponential (POE) formulas. The Newton-Raphson iteration method is employed for solution. The automated model generation is accomplished through the introduction of Assembly Incidence Matrix (AIM) representation of a modular robot assembly configuration and the related accessibility matrix and path matrix. Examples of the inverse kinematics solutions for different types of modular robots are given to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. 1},

In this paper, we examine global localization, where the robot localizes itself globally, without any prior location estimate. This is achieved by matching distinctive visual landmarks in the current frame to a database map. A Hough transform approach and a RANSAC approach for global localization are compared, showing that RANSAC is much more efficient for matching specific features, but much worse for matching nonspecific features. Moreover, robust global localization can be achieved by matching a small submap of the local region built from multiple frames. This submap alignment algorithm for global localization can be applied to map building, which can be regarded as alignment of multiple 3-D submaps. A global minimization procedure is carried out using the loop closure constraint to avoid the effects of slippage and drift accumulation. Landmark uncertainty is taken into account in the submap alignment and the global minimization process. Experiments show that global localization can be achieved accurately using the scale-invariant landmarks. Our approach of pairwise submap alignment with backward correction in a consistent manner produces a better global 3-D map.},

The forward kinematics is derived using D-H method, while the inverse kinematics and its workspace can be solved by geometric analysis. To validate the design, a prototype is built. It is found that the positioning error of the robot arm is generally less than 2\%. The advantage of this robot arm is that with several nodes fixed the rest nodes are still controllable. The positioning error is smaller when the fixed node is closer to the end effector.},

	abstract = {Endoscopic minimally invasive surgeries (MIS) are being more common procedures in hospitals. Instead of a single large opening, only several small incisions are needed to be opened through the patient to perform the surgery. As such, MIS has better recovery rate and efficiency than convention surgeries. However, the access ports of such surgeries constrain conventional MIS instruments made of straight rigid bodies to limited degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) and distal dexterity. Also, tight and irregular spaces within the human body restrict and complicate the surgery procedure due to the maneuverability of the instruments. To address these challenges and achieve more flexible manipulations inside human body, a new snake-like robotic system was developed combining the usage of springs and support structures and the concept of parallel manipulators using push-pull wire actuation. Such robotic systems are needed due to the limited space of the small access ports opened through the human body during minimally invasive surgeries. Instead of using a central backbone and the multiple plates of the distal dexterity units, a spring was used as the supporting structure of the robot. The characteristics of a spring are exploited in this design to enable the robot to orientate and position with increased maneuverability. A simple support structure is then inserted into the spring to allow for wire actuation. Key design considerations and features are discussed. The prototype of the robotic system is able to achieve five degree of freedoms through the actuation control and show the feasibility of active steering intracorporeal endoscopes.},

Particularly, the torque sensing system and the terrain adaptive control based on that allows us to operate the robot in challenging environment without observing the robot directly. We also showed the feasibility of our concept through the testing of the ACM-R4.1.

Different from conventional rigid manipulators, their end-effectors are positioned by deforming the flexible backbone. Existing workspace analysis of cable-driven continuum manipulators is based on kinematic modeling, in which the piecewise constant curvature assumption is adopted and the effect from external payload is fully neglected. In this work, we propose a method of analyzing the workspace using static analysis, which takes into account the internal cable tension, the external payload and the gravity force. Experiments are made through a continuum manipulator that is 90 mm in length and 7 mm in diameter to validate the proposed static model. Root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) are used to evaluate the differences between modeling and experiment. Results show that the average RMSEs along axial and lateral directions are 0.8 mm and 1.1 mm for the horizontal experimental layout, 0.4 mm and 0.1 mm for the vertical experimental layout. Based on the experimentally validated static model, workspace of a cable-driven continuum manipulator is analyzed. Results show that the workspace is much affected by the external axial force and lateral force, while is not affected by a pure bending moment. This indicates that the statics has to be considered in workspace analysis of continuum manipulators.},

It is shown that one fixed value of the scalar coefficient is not suitable even in a small workspace. The proposed manipulation scheme automatically chooses an appropriate magnitude of the self motion throughout the workspace. This scheme guarantees joint limit avoidance and also minimizes unnecessary self motion. It is implemented and tested for real-time control of a seven-degree-of-freedom manipulator},

This is a local optimization method that can prevent infeasible joint velocities near singular configurations by using a damping factor to control the norm of the joint velocity vector. However, the exactness of the inverse kinematic solution has to be sacrificed in order to achieve feasibility.The damping factor is an important parameter in this technique since it determines the trade-off between the accuracy and feasibility of the inverse kinematic solution. Various methods that have been proposed to compute an appropriate damping factor are described.Redundant manipulators, possessing extra degrees of freedom, afford more choice of inverse kinematic solutions than do non-redundant ones. The damped least-squares method has been used in conjunction with redundancy resolution schemes to compute feasible joint velocities for redundant arms while performing an additional subtask. We outline the different techniques that have been proposed to achieve this objective. In addition, we introduce an iterative method to compute the optimal damping factor for one of the redundancy resolution techniques.},

	abstract = {Collaborative robot manipulators are being used to assist human workers performing physically intensive tasks. The finite reach of the manipulator often results in the robot being operated in proximity to kinematic singularity, negatively affecting the stability and performance of operation. Methods of controlling manipulators in the proximity of singularities and mitigating their effects on performance have been widely researched. However, little attention has been given to developing suitable methods for handling singularities specifically for applications where the manipulator physically interacts with a human operator. In these applications additional factors such as human comfort and interaction experience need to be considered. This work presents a framework for handling robotic singularities developed with the human operator in mind. Singularity robustness is achieved using a novel approach to dampen motion of the manipulator along singular directions. An exponential scaling shapes the damping to create a smooth behavior beneficial for physical human–robot interaction. The damping is applied asymmetrically depending on if the robot is heading towards or away from singular configurations, improving the interaction experience for the human operator. Additionally, bounded virtual forces are used to subtly guide the operator away from singular configurations. The proposed framework is validated in simulation and tested on an industrial manipulator.},

However, the increasing complexity also raises the question of how to resolve the kinematic redundancy which is a direct consequence of the large number of DOFs. Here we give an overview of the most practical and frequently used torque control solutions based on null space projections. Two fundamental structures of task hierarchies are reviewed and compared, namely the successive and the augmented method. Then the projector itself is investigated in terms of its consistency. We analyze static, dynamic, and the new concept of stiffness consistency. In the latter case, stiffness information is used in the pseudoinversion instead of the inertia matrix. In terms of dynamic consistency, we generalize the weighting matrix from the classical operational space approach and show that an infinite number of weighting matrices exist to obtain dynamic consistency. In this context we also analyze another dynamically consistent null space projector with slightly different structure and properties. The redundancy resolutions are finally compared in several simulations and experiments. A thorough discussion of the theoretical and empirical results completes this survey.},

By combining a modified Lagrange polynomial series solution, based on experimental observations, with Ritz and Ritz-Galerkin methods, the infinite modeling state space of a continuum manipulator is minimized to geometrical position of a handful of physical points (in our case two). As a result, a unified easy to implement vector formalism is proposed for the nonlinear impedance and configuration control. We showed that by considering the mechanical effects of highly elastic axial deformation, the model accuracy is increased up to 6\%. The proposed model predicts experimental results with 6\%-8\% (4-6 mm) mean error for the Ritz-Galerkin method in static cases and 16\%-20\% (12-14 mm) mean error for the Ritz method in dynamic cases, in planar and general three-dimensional motions. Comparing to five different models in the literature, our approximate solution is shown to be more accurate with the smallest possible number of modeling states and suitable for real-time modeling, observation, and control applications.},

To design the hyper-redundant robot, the multiple section structure is used. Each section consists of two rotational joints, a link mechanism, and three cables. In this sense, two degrees of freedom are achieved. For kinematics analysis between the actuator space and joint space, each section of the development is treated as three spherical–prismatic–spherical chains and a universal joint chain (3-SPS-U), which results in a four-chain parallel mechanism model. In order to obtain the forward kinematics from the joint space to task space directly and easily, the coordinate frames are established by the geometrical rules rather than the traditional Denavit–Hartenburg (D-H) rules. To solve the problem of inverse kinematics analysis, we utilize the product of exponentials approach. Finally, a prototype of 24-degrees of freedom hyper-redundant robot with 12 sections and 36 cables is fabricated and an experiment platform is built for real-time control of the robot. Different experiments in terms of trajectories tracking test, positioning accuracy test, and payload test are conducted for the validation of both mechanical design and model development. Experiment results demonstrate that the presented hyper-redundant robot has fine position accuracy, flexibility with mean position error less than 2\%, and good load capacity.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the first randomized approach to kinodynamic planning (also known                 as trajectory planning or trajectory design). The task is to determine control                 inputs to drive a robot from an ini ial configuration and velocity to a goal                 configuration and velocity while obeying physically based dynamical models and                 avoiding obstacles in the robot’s environment. The authors consider                 generic systems that express the nonlinear dynamics of a robot in terms of the                 robot’s high-dimensional configuration space. Kinodynamic planning is                 treated as a motion-planning problem in a higher dimensional state space that has                 both first-order differential constraints and obstacle-based global constraints. The                 state space serves the same role as the configuration space for basic path planning;                 however, standard randomized path-planning techniques do not directly apply to                 planning trajectories in the state space. The authors have developed a randomized                 planning approach that is particularly tailored to trajectory planning problems in                 high-dimensional state spaces. The basis for this approach is the construction of                 rapidly exploring random trees, which offer benefits that are similar to those                 obtained by successful randomized holonomic planning methods but apply to a much                 broader class of problems. Theoretical analysis of the algorithm is given.                 Experimental results are presented for an implementation that computes trajectories                 for hovercrafts and satellites in cluttered environments, resulting in state spaces                 of up to 12 dimensions.},

Like CHOMP (Covariant Hamiltonian Optimization for Motion Planning), our algorithm can be used to find collision-free trajectories from naïve, straight-line initializations that might be in collision. At the core of our approach are (a) a sequential convex optimization procedure, which penalizes collisions with a hinge loss and increases the penalty coefficients in an outer loop as necessary, and (b) an efficient formulation of the no-collisions constraint that directly considers continuous-time safety Our algorithm is implemented in a software package called TrajOpt., We report results from a series of experiments comparing TrajOpt with CHOMP and randomized planners from OMPL, with regard to planning time and path quality. We consider motion planning for 7 DOF robot arms, 18 DOF full-body robots, statically stable walking motion for the 34 DOF Atlas humanoid robot, and physical experiments with the 18 DOF PR2.

	abstract = {Steerable needles have the potential to improve the effectiveness of needle-based clinical procedures such as biopsy and drug delivery by improving targeting accuracy and reaching previously inaccessible targets that are behind sensitive or impenetrable anatomical regions. We present a new needle steering system capable of automatically reaching targets in 3-D environments while avoiding obstacles and compensating for real-world uncertainties. Given a specification of anatomical obstacles and a clinical target (e.g., from preoperative medical images), our system plans and controls needle motion in a closed-loop fashion under sensory feedback to optimize a clinical metric. We unify planning and control using a new fast algorithm that continuously replans the needle motion. Our rapid replanning approach is enabled by an efficient sampling-based rapidly exploring random tree (RRT) planner that achieves orders-of-magnitude reduction in computation time compared with prior 3-D approaches by incorporating variable curvature kinematics and a novel distance metric for planning. Our system uses an electromagnetic tracking system to sense the state of the needle tip during the procedure. We experimentally evaluate our needle steering system using tissue phantoms and animal tissue ex vivo. We demonstrate that our rapid replanning strategy successfully guides the needle around obstacles to desired 3-D targets with an average error of less than 3 mm.},

	abstract = {The Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm, based on incremental sampling, efficiently computes motion plans. Although the RRT algorithm quickly produces candidate feasible solutions, it tends to converge to a solution that is far from optimal. Practical applications favor "anytime" algorithms that quickly identify an initial feasible plan, then, given more computation time available during plan execution, improve the plan toward an optimal solution. This paper describes an anytime algorithm based on the RRT* which (like the RRT) finds an initial feasible solution quickly, but (unlike the RRT) almost surely converges to an optimal solution. We present two key extensions to the RRT\% committed trajectories and branch-and-bound tree adaptation, that together enable the algorithm to make more efficient use of computation time online, resulting in an anytime algorithm for real-time implementation. We evaluate the method using a series of Monte Carlo runs in a high-fidelity simulation environment, and compare the operation of the RRT and RRT* methods. We also demonstrate experimental results for an outdoor wheeled robotic vehicle.},

	abstract = {We propose a novel solution to the problem of inverse kinematics for redundant robotic manipulators for the purposes of goal selection for path planning. We unify the calculation of the goal configuration with searching for a path in order to avoid the uncertainties inherent to selecting goal configurations which may be unreachable because they currently lie in components of the free configuration space disconnected from the initial configuration. We adopt workspace heuristic functions that implicitly define goal regions of the configuration space and guide the extension of rapidly-exploring random trees (RRTs), which are used to search for these regions. The algorithm has successfully been used to efficiently plan reaching and grasping motions for a humanoid robot equipped with redundant manipulator arms},

	title = {Incremental {Sampling}-based {Algorithms} for {Optimal} {Motion} {Planning}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.0416},
	abstract = {During the last decade, incremental sampling-based motion planning algorithms, such as the Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs) have been shown to work well in practice and to possess theoretical guarantees such as probabilistic completeness. However, no theoretical bounds on the quality of the solution obtained by these algorithms have been established so far. The first contribution of this paper is a negative result: it is proven that, under mild technical conditions, the cost of the best path in the RRT converges almost surely to a non-optimal value. Second, a new algorithm is considered, called the Rapidly-exploring Random Graph (RRG), and it is shown that the cost of the best path in the RRG converges to the optimum almost surely. Third, a tree version of RRG is introduced, called the RRT\${\textasciicircum}*\$ algorithm, which preserves the asymptotic optimality of RRG while maintaining a tree structure like RRT. The analysis of the new algorithms hinges on novel connections between sampling-based motion planning algorithms and the theory of random geometric graphs. In terms of computational complexity, it is shown that the number of simple operations required by both the RRG and RRT\${\textasciicircum}*\$ algorithms is asymptotically within a constant factor of that required by RRT.},

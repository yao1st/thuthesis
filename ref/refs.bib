  abstract = {Surgical robots are gaining favor in part due to their capacity to reach remote locations within the body. Continuum robots are especially well suited for accessing deep spaces such as cerebral ventricles within the brain. Due to the entry point constraints and complicated structure, current techniques do not allow surgeons to access the full volume of the ventricles. The ability to access the ventricles with a dexterous robot would have significant clinical implications. This paper presents a concentric tube manipulator mated to a robotically controlled flexible endoscope. The device adds three degrees of freedom to the standard neuroendoscope and roboticizes the entire package allowing the operator to conveniently manipulate the device. To demonstrate the improved functionality, we use an in-silica virtual model as well as an ex-vivo anatomic model of a patient with a treatable form of hydrocephalus. In these experiments we demonstrate that the augmented and roboticized endoscope can efficiently reach critical regions that a manual scope cannot.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a potential-field-based real-time path planning algorithm for a multi-segment continuum manipulator is proposed. This planner is employed to enable a continuum-style manipulator to move autonomously in dynamic environments in real-time. The classic potential field method is modified to make it applicable for a kinematics model based on the constant-curvature assumption. The contribution of this paper lies in the design of a novel potential field in the actuator space satisfying the mechanical constraints of the manipulator. The planning algorithm is tested and validated in real-time simulation for a 3 segments continuum manipulator. Preliminary tests for a tendon-driven single-segment continuum manipulator prototype confirm the performance of the proposed planner.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new class of thin, dexterous continuum robots, which we call active cannulas due to their potential medical applications. An active cannula is composed of telescoping, concentric, precurved superelastic tubes that can be axially translated and rotated at the base relative to one another. Active cannulas derive bending not from tendon wires or other external mechanisms but from elastic tube interaction in the backbone itself, permitting high dexterity and small size, and dexterity improves with miniaturization. They are designed to traverse narrow and winding environments without relying on ldquoguidingrdquo environmental reaction forces. These features seem ideal for a variety of applications where a very thin robot with tentacle-like dexterity is needed. In this paper, we apply beam mechanics to obtain a kinematic model of active cannula shape and describe design tools that result from the modeling process. After deriving general equations, we apply them to a simple three-link active cannula. Experimental results illustrate the importance of including torsional effects and the ability of our model to predict energy bifurcation and active cannula shape.},

  abstract = {Concentric tube robots are catheter-sized continuum robots that are well suited for minimally invasive surgery inside confined body cavities. These robots are constructed from sets of precurved superelastic tubes and are capable of assuming complex 3-D curves. The family of 3-D curves that the robot can assume depends on the number, curvatures, lengths, and stiffnesses of the tubes in its tube set. The robot design problem involves solving for a tube set that will produce the family of curves necessary to perform a surgical procedure. At a minimum, these curves must enable the robot to smoothly extend into the body and to manipulate tools over the desired surgical workspace while respecting anatomical constraints. This paper introduces an optimization framework that utilizes procedure- or patient-specific image-based anatomical models along with surgical workspace requirements to generate robot tube set designs. The algorithm searches for designs that minimize robot length and curvature and for which all paths required for the procedure consist of stable robot configurations. Two mechanics-based kinematic models are used. Initial designs are sought using a model assuming torsional rigidity. These designs are then refined using a torsionally compliant model. The approach is illustrated with clinically relevant examples from neurosurgery and intracardiac surgery.},

In this paper, we address the novel problem of real-time motion planning for such a robot under uncertain conditions. We present an algorithm for on-line planning the motion of a planar continuum robot for grasping a target object amid an environment of other objects with uncertain movements.

In this paper, we detail methods for the efficient numerical solution of this model at rates that enable real-time interactive simulation, motion planning, design optimization, and control. Exploitation of the model structure enables a significant reduction in the number of integrations required to evaluate the boundary value Jacobian matrix used in a shooting method.

Another reason is the dynamic coupling between the actuators that cannot be neglected during fast motions. Therefore, a model-based MIMO controller in actuator space was developed, that is based on a spatial dynamic model with one mass point per section. Using feedback linearization, the actuators can be decoupled and feedforward control in combination with linear controllers can be applied. Measurements of an example manipulator show the good tracking result of pure feedforward action with feedback linearization. Adding a linear PD-controller increases the robustness against disturbances without reducing the possibility of fast motions.},

In this paper we develop a new coordinate-free energy formulation that accounts for general preshaping of an arbitrary number of component tubes, and which explicitly includes both bending and torsion throughout the device. We show that previously reported models are special cases of our formulation, and then explore in detail the implications of torsional flexibility for the special case of two tubes. Experiments demonstrate that this framework is more descriptive of physical prototype behavior than previous models1 it reduces model prediction error by 82\% over the calibrated bending-only model, and 17\% over the calibrated transmissional torsion model in a set of experiments.},

While these models have been demonstrated to approximate actual behavior, modeling error can be significant for medical applications that often call for positioning accuracy of 1-2mm. As an alternative to moving to more complex models, this paper proposes using sensing to adaptively update model parameters during robot operation. Advantages of this method are that the model is constantly tuning itself to provide high accuracy in the region of the workspace where it is currently operating. It also adapts automatically to changes in robot shape and compliance associated with the insertion and removal of tools through its lumen. As an initial exploration of this approach, a recursive on-line estimator is proposed and evaluated experimentally.},

  doi = {10.1177/0278364915596450},
  abstract = {Variable length multisection continuum arms are a class of continuum robotic manipulators that generate motion by structural mechanical deformation. Unlike most continuum robots, the sections of these arms do not have (central) supporting flexible backbone, and are actuated by multiple variable length actuators. Because of the constraining nature of actuators, the continuum sections can bend and/or elongate (compress) depending on the elongation/contraction characteristics of the actuators being used. Continuum arms have a number of distinctive differences with respect to traditional rigid arms namely: smooth bending, high inherent compliance, and adaptive whole arm grasping. However, due to numerical instability and the complexity of curve parametric models, there are no spatial dynamic models for multisection continuum arms. This paper introduces novel spatial dynamics and applies these to variable length multisection continuum arms with any number of sections. An efficient recursive computational scheme for deriving the equations of motion is presented. This is applied in a general form based on structurally accurate and numerically well-posed modal kinematics that assumes circular arc deformation of continuum sections without torsion. It is shown that the proposed modal dynamics are highly scalable, producing efficient and accurate numerical results. The spatial dynamic simulation results are experimentally validated using a pneumatic muscle actuated multisection prototype continuum arm.

  abstract = {This paper introduces three algorithms which are essential for the practical, real-time implementation of continuum robots. Continuum robots lack the joints and links which compose traditional and high-degree-of-freedom robots, instead relying on finite actuation mechanisms to shape the robot into a smooth curve. Actuator length limits shape the configuration or joint space of continuum manipulators, introducing couplings analyzed in this paper which must be understood to make effective use of continuum robot hardware. Based on the new understanding of the configuration space uncovered, this paper then derives the workspace of continuum robots when constrained by actuator length limits. Finally, a tangle/untangle algorithm correctly computes the shape of the distal segments of multisection tendon-actuated continuum robots. These contributions are essential for effective use of a wide range of continuum robots, and have been implemented and tested on two different types of continuum robots. Results and insight gained from this implementation are presented},

  doi = {10.1109/ICRA.2016.7487223},
  abstract = {Path following and follow-the-leader motion is particularly desirable for minimally-invasive surgery in confined spaces which can only be reached using tortuous paths, e.g. through natural orifices. While path following and followthe- leader motion can be achieved by hyper-redundant snake robots, their size is usually not applicable for medical applications. Continuum robots, such as tendon-driven or concentric tube mechanisms, fulfill the size requirements for minimally invasive surgery, but yet follow-the-leader motion is not inherently provided. In fact, parameters of the manipulator's section curvatures and translation have to be chosen wisely a priori. In this paper, we consider a tendon-driven continuum robot with extensible sections. After reformulating the forward kinematics model, we formulate prerequisites for follow-the-leader motion and present a general approach to determine a sequence of robot configurations to achieve follow-the-leader motion along a given 3D path. We evaluate our approach in a series of simulations with 3D paths composed of constant curvature arcs and general 3D paths described by B-spline curves. Our results show that mean path errors $<$;0.4mm and mean tip errors $<$;1.6mm can theoretically be achieved for constant curvature paths and $<$;2mm and $<$;3.1mm for general B-spline curves respectively.},

  abstract = {Continuum robotic manipulators articulate due to their inherent compliance. Tendon actuation leads to compression of the manipulator, extension of the actuators, and is limited by the practical constraint that tendons cannot support compression. In light of these observations, we present a new linear model for transforming desired beam configuration to tendon displacements and vice versa. We begin from first principles in solid mechanics by analyzing the effects of geometrically nonlinear tendon loads. These loads act both distally at the termination point and proximally along the conduit contact interface. The resulting model simplifies to a linear system including only the bending and axial modes of the manipulator as well as the actuator compliance. The model is then manipulated to form a concise mapping from beam configuration-space parameters to n redundant tendon displacements via the internal loads and strains experienced by the system. We demonstrate the utility of this model by implementing an optimal feasible controller. The controller regulates axial strain to a constant value while guaranteeing positive tendon forces and minimizing their magnitudes over a range of articulations. The mechanics-based model from this study provides insight as well as performance gains for this increasingly ubiquitous class of manipulators.},

The manipulator relies on the use of a soft flexible fluidic actuator in each of its modules, which can be wireless controlled by means of an embedded fluidic control unit. This actuation unit is equipped with three miniaturized latching valves, a wireless microcontroller board, and a specifically designed fluidic distributor integrated into the elastomeric material that the module is made of. FEM simulations and experimental tests verified the reliability of the distributor in acting as a piping system inside each module. The mobility of the fully integrated soft module was evaluated in terms of static performances and covered workspace. The module's dynamic model during one-chamber motion was estimated from the parameter estimation analysis. The characterization of the single module behaviour is intended as first step to ease the future high level control of the multi-modular architecture.},

The actuation loading on the robot by the actuation rods is formulated based on the calculation of contact forces that result in rod equilibrium. Numerical optimization calculates the magnitudes of these forces, and an iterative solver simultaneously estimates the robot's friction and contact forces. In addition, modeling considerations including variable elastic loading among segments and mutual segment loading due to rods terminating at different disks are presented. The resulting static and dynamic models have been compared to dynamic finite element analyses and experimental results to validate their accuracy.},

The control law is based on an accurate approximation of a continuum robot's coupled kinematic and static force model. To implement a desired tip stiffness, the controller drives the actuators to positions corresponding to a deflected robot configuration that produces the required tip force for the measured tip position. This approach provides several important advantages. First, it enables the use of robot deflection sensing as a means to both sense and control tip forces. Second, it enables stiffness control to be implemented by modification of existing continuum robot position controllers. The proposed controller is demonstrated experimentally in the context of a concentric tube robot. Results show that the stiffness controller achieves the desired stiffness in steady state, provides good dynamic performance, and exhibits stability during contact transitions.},

The focus of this paper lies in the sensor-based position control of the ColoBot for guiding the advancement in a tubular, compliant and slippery environment. The kinematic model related the position of the distal end of the ColoBot to the actuator inputs which is firstly developed and formulated to control the shape of the ColoBot through position control of the distal tip. To achieve safe guidance, the ideal position of the tip should be in the central axis of the colon. A method based on a circumscribed circle is proposed to approximate the central position in real-time based on three sensor readings. This position will be used as reference position for the tip to adjust its shape in real time to avoid the contact with tube wall. This proposed approach can be extended to the control of continuum robots in the conditions of a dynamically confined space. The simulation results and experimental results with a curved tube will be presented in order to validate the proposed control strategy.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel and unified analytic formulation for kinematics, statics, and shape restoration of multiple-backbone continuum robots. These robots achieve actuation redundancy by independently pulling and pushing three backbones to carry out a bending motion of two-degrees-of-freedom (DoF). A solution framework based on constraints of geometric compatibility and static equilibrium is derived using elliptic integrals. This framework allows the investigation of the effects of different external loads and actuation redundancy resolutions on the shape variations in these continuum robots. The simulation and experimental validation results show that these continuum robots bend into an exact circular shape for one particular actuation resolution. This provides a proof to the ubiquitously accepted circular-shape assumption in deriving kinematics for continuum robots. The shape variations due to various actuation redundancy resolutions are also investigated. The simulation results show that these continuum robots have the ability to redistribute loads among their backbones without introducing significant shape variations. A strategy for partially restoring the shape of the externally loaded continuum robots is proposed. The simulation results show that either the tip orientation or the tip position can be successfully restored.},

  abstract = {Compliant joints composed of slit tubes or springs are commonly utilized for steerable endoscopes and catheters. Because this type of joint is actuated by means of its elasticity, it is difficult to bend it with a small radius of curvature. In order to overcome this problem, a hyper-redundant Pulleyless Rolling joint with Elastic Fixtures (PREF joint) is proposed. To enable miniaturization, the PREF joint does not have a pulley, and the rolling contact motion aids the actuation cables to maintain the tension. The elastic fixtures guarantee a stable rolling motion at the center of the rolling surfaces. In this paper, the fundamental characteristics for the unit and the hyper-redundant PREF joints are presented. Moreover, design considerations are proposed for the PREF joint including the rolling tooth shape, structure of the elastic fixtures, and cable actuation method. The validity of the design is verified using finite-element analysis and a 10 mm diameter prototype composed of 12 units of PREF joints for a 1 degree-of-freedom motion. As a result, the 55 mm long joint can be bent up to $\pm$180$^\circ$ with low actuation tension. The presented guidelines will assist in the development of various steerable instruments for medical applications.},

  abstract = {Continuum robotics has rapidly become a rich and diverse area of research, with many designs and applications demonstrated. Despite this diversity in form and purpose, there exists remarkable similarity in the fundamental simplified kinematic models that have been applied to continuum robots. However, this can easily be obscured, especially to a newcomer to the field, by the different applications, coordinate frame choices, and analytical formalisms employed. In this paper we review several modeling approaches in a common frame and notational convention, illustrating that for piecewise constant curvature, they produce identical results. This discussion elucidates what has been articulated in different ways by a number of researchers in the past several years, namely that constant-curvature kinematics can be considered as consisting of two separate submappings: one that is general and applies to all continuum robots, and another that is robot-specific. These mappings are then developed both for the single-section and for the multi-section case. Similarly, we discuss the decomposition of differential kinematics (the robot's Jacobian) into robot-specific and robot-independent portions. The paper concludes with a perspective on several of the themes of current research that are shaping the future of continuum robotics.},

In this paper a direct and inverse kinetics models are described for a non-constant curvature structure. A major effort has been put recently in modelling and controlling constant curvature structures, such as cylindrical shaped manipulators. Manipulators with non-constant curvature, on the other hand, have been treated with a piecewise constant curvature approximation. In this work a non-constant curvature manipulator with a conical shape is built, taking inspiration from the anatomy of the octopus arm. The choice of a conical shape manipulator made of soft material is justified by its enhanced capability in grasping objects of different sizes. A different approach from the piecewise constant curvature approximation is employed for direct and inverse kinematics model. A continuum geometrically exact approach for direct kinetics model and a Jacobian method for inverse case are proposed. They are validated experimentally with a prototype soft robot arm moving in water.

The adaptive computed-torque control algorithm applied to robot manipulators of lumped systems is extended to design the adaptive boundary controller for the coupling system.

Lyapunov stability guarantees the convergence of the tracking error to zero. Finally, the performance of the proposed controller is demonstrated by numerical simulations.},

Recent mechanics-based models of these ``active cannulas'' are able to accurately describe the curve of the robot in free space, given the preformed tube curves and the linear and angular positions of the tube bases. However, in practical applications, where the active cannula must interact with its environment or apply controlled forces, a model that accounts for deformation under external loading is required. In this paper, we apply geometrically exact rod theory to produce a forward kinematic model that accurately describes large deflections due to a general collection of externally applied point and/or distributed wrench loads. This model accommodates arbitrarily many tubes, with each having a general preshaped curve. It also describes the independent torsional deformation of the individual tubes. Experimental results are provided for both point and distributed loads. Average tip error under load was 2.91 mm (1.5\% - 3\% of total robot length), which is similar to the accuracy of existing free-space models.},

Most prior robots have used tendons routed in straight paths along the robot. However, routing tendons through general curved paths within the robot offers potential advantages in reshaping the workspace and enabling a single section of the robot to achieve a wider variety of desired shapes. In this paper, we provide a new model for the statics and dynamics of robots with general tendon routing paths that is derived by coupling the classical Cosserat-rod and Cosserat-string models. This model also accounts for general external loading conditions and includes traditional axially routed tendons as a special case. The advantage of the usage of this coupled model for straight-tendon robots is that it accounts for the distributed wrenches that tendons apply along the robot. We show that these are necessary to consider when the robot is subjected to out-of-plane external loads. Our experimental results demonstrate that the coupled model matches experimental tip positions with an error of 1.7\% of the robot length, in a set of experiments that include both straight and nonstraight routing cases, with both point and distributed external loads.},

This requires a non-trivial extension of previously proposed kinematic models, and poses challenges for real-time control of the robot. We introduce a tangling/untangling algorithm to map between overall cable lengths and per-section cable lengths. Details of the design and its implementation are presented, along with a summary of real-time control issues and experimental results.},

Natural systems, however, often match or exceed the performance of robotic systems with deformable bodies. Cephalopods, for example, achieve amazing feats of manipulation and locomotion without a skeleton; even vertebrates such as humans achieve dynamic gaits by storing elastic energy in their compliant bones and soft tissues.

Specifically, we present an extremely soft robotic manipulator morphology that is composed entirely from low durometer elastomer, powered by pressurized air, and designed to be both modular and durable. To understand the deformation of a single arm segment, we develop and experimentally validate a static deformation model. Then, to kinematically model the multi-segment manipulator, we use a piece-wise constant curvature assumption consistent with more traditional continuum manipulators. In addition, we define a complete fabrication process for this new manipulator and use this process to make multiple functional prototypes. In order to power the robot's spatial actuation, a high capacity fluidic drive cylinder array is implemented, providing continuously variable, closed-circuit gas delivery. Next, using real-time data from a vision system, we develop a processing and control algorithm that generates realizable kinematic curvature trajectories and controls the manipulator's configuration along these trajectories. Lastly, we experimentally demonstrate new capabilities offered by this soft fluidic elastomer manipulation system such as entering and advancing through confined three-dimensional environments as well as conforming to goal shape-configurations within a sagittal plane under closed-loop control.},

  abstract = {Snake-like flexible manipulators are widely used in minimally invasive surgery (MIS), which require adequate dexterity in confined workspace. Typically, the design mechanisms of these manipulators include tendon-driven mechanism and concentric tube mechanism. Though, the workspace and dexterity of these designs are limited due to the lack of control in either the length of the bending section or the curvature of the bending section at the distal end. In this paper, we present a novel constrained wire-driven flexible mechanism (CWFM), in which both the length and the curvature of the bending section are controllable. The idea is to employ an active constraint to control the length of the bending section and use the wires to control the curvature of the bending section. Compared to the existing designs based on wire-driven flexible mechanism (WFM), CWFM has expanded workspace and enhanced dexterity while its size is not sacrificed. Additional benefits include much reduced sweeping area and controllable stiffness. Based on the computer simulation, on average, CWFM with the same size as WFM can improve the dexterity by 4.69 times and reduce the sweeping area to 20.5\%.},

However, obstacle interactions impose constraints that conform the robot body into arbitrary shapes regardless of actuator positions. Generally, these effects cannot be wholly sensed on a continuum manipulator and, therefore, render model-based controllers incorrect, leading to artificial singularities and unstable behavior. We present a task-space closed-loop controller for continuum manipulators that does not rely on a model and can be used in constrained environments. Using an optimal control strategy on a tendon-driven robot, we demonstrate this method, which we term model-less control, which allows the manipulator to interact with several constrained environments in a stable manner. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work in controlling continuum manipulators without using a model.},

The results show that the sensible wrenches belong to a 2-D screw system and the insensible wrenches belong to a 4-D screw system. The theory presented in this paper is validated through simulations and experiments. It is shown that the force sensing errors have an average of 0.34 g with a standard deviation of 0.83 g. Another experiment of generating the stiffness map of a silicone strip suggests possible medical application of palpation for tumor detection. The presented study allows force sensing in challenging environments where placing force sensors at the distal end of a robot is not possible due to limitations such as size and MRI compatibility.},

Therefore, a practicable lumped mass model similar to common dynamic models of rigid-link manipulators is needed, which can be used for simulations and model-based control design. The model incorporates mechanical interconnections of parallel and serially connected bellows and uses constant curvature kinematics and its analytical derivatives to balance forces and energies in a global reference frame. The parameters of the resulting model are identified with measurements before the simulation results are experimentally validated.

  abstract = {Traditionally, robot manipulators have been a simple arrangement of a small number of serially connected links and actuated joints. Though these manipulators prove to be very effective for many tasks, they are not without their limitations, due mainly to their lack of maneuverability or total degrees of freedom. Continuum style (i.e., continuous ``back-bone'') robots, on the other hand, exhibit a wide range of maneuverability, and can have a large number of degrees of freedom. The motion of continuum style robots is generated through the bending of the robot over a given section; unlike traditional robots where the motion occurs in discrete locations, i.e., joints. The motion of continuum manipulators is often compared to that of biological manipulators such as trunks and tentacles. These continuum style robots can achieve motions that could only be obtainable by a conventionally designed robot with many more degrees of freedom. In this paper we present a detailed formulation and explanation of a novel kinematic model for continuum style robots. The design, construction, and implementation of our continuum style robot called the elephant trunk manipulator is presented. Experimental results are then provided to verify the legitimacy of our model when applied to our physical manipulator. We also provide a set of obstacle avoidance experiments that help to exhibit the practical implementation of both our manipulator and our kinematic model. \textcopyright{} 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {Continuum robots exhibit great potential in a number of challenging applications where traditional rigid link robots pose certain limitations, e.g., working in unstructured environments. In order to enable the usage of continuum robots in safety-critical applications, such as surgery and nuclear decontamination, it is extremely important to ensure a safe path for the robot's movement. Existing algorithms for continuum robot path planning have certain limitations that need to be addressed. These include the fact that none of the algorithms provide safety assurance parameters and control for path planning. They are computationally expensive, applicable to a specific type of continuum robots, and mostly they do not incorporate design and kinematics constraints. In this paper, we propose a points-based path planning (PoPP) algorithm for continuum robots that computes the path by imposing safety constraints and improves upon the limitations of existing approaches. In the algorithm, we exploit the constant curvature-bending property of continuum robots in their path planning process. The algorithm is computationally efficient and provides a good tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency that can be implemented to enable the safety-critical application of continuum robots. This algorithm also provides information regarding path volume and flexibility in movement. Simulation results confirm that the algorithm possesses promising potential for all types of continuum robots (following the constant curvature-bending property). We believe that this effectively balances the desired safety and efficiency requirements.},

This optimization is used to minimize a set of changes to the arrangement of the snake arm that lets the algorithm follow the desired trajectory with minimal error. The information of the Snake Arm pose is used to limit deviations from the path taken. Therefore, the main objective is to find an efficient objective function that allows uninterrupted movements in real-time. The method proposed is validated through an extensive set of simulations of common arrangements and poses for the snake arm robot. For a 24 DoF robot, the average computation time is 0.4~s, achieving a speed of 4.5~mm/s, with deviation of no more than 25~mm from the ideal path.},

  abstract = {Concentric tube robots are needle-sized manipulators which have been investigated for use in minimally invasive surgeries. It was noted early in the development of these devices that elastic energy storage can lead to a rapid snapping motion for designs with moderate to high tube curvatures. Substantial progress has recently been made in the concentric tube robot community in designing snap-free robots, planning stable paths, and characterizing conditions that result in snapping for specific classes of concentric tube robots. However, a general measure for determining the stability of a given robot configuration has yet to be proposed. In this paper, we use bifurcation and elastic stability theory to provide such a measure, as well as to produce a test for determining whether a given design is snap-free (i.e., whether snapping can occur anywhere in the unloaded robot's workspace). These results are useful in designing, planning motions for, and controlling concentric tube robots with high curvatures.},

The differential equations of the mechanical model are non-linear, therefore the analytical solutions are difficult to calculate. Since the exact solutions of the mechanical model are not available, the elements of the Jacobian matrix can not be calculated. To overcome intrinsic problems of the methods based on the Jacobian matrix, we propose for the first time a neural network learning the inverse kinetics of the soft manipulator moving in three-dimensional space. After the training, a feed-forward neural network (FNN) is able to represent the relation between the manipulator tip position and the forces applied to the cables. The results show that a desired tip position can be achieved with a degree of accuracy of 1.36\% relative average error with respect to the total arm length.},

Inspired by biological trunks, tentacles, and snakes, continuum robot designs can traverse confined spaces, manipulate objects in complex environments, and conform to curvilinear paths in space. In addition, many designs offer inherent structural compliance and ease of miniaturization. After decades of pioneering research, a host of designs have now been investigated and have demonstrated capabilities beyond the scope of conventional rigid-link robots. Recently, we have seen increasing efforts aimed at leveraging these qualities to improve the frontiers of minimally invasive surgical interventions. Several concepts have now been commercialized, which are inspiring and enabling a current paradigm shift in surgical approaches toward flexible access routes, e.g., through natural orifices such as the nose. In this paper, we provide an overview of the current state of this field from the perspectives of both robotics science and medical applications. We discuss relevant research in design, modeling, control, and sensing for continuum manipulators, and we highlight how this work is being used to build robotic systems for specific surgical procedures. We provide perspective for the future by discussing current limitations, open questions, and challenges.},

In this paper, we present the modeling, sensing and control of multi-backbone continuum robots in a unified framework for hybrid motion/force control. Multi-backbone continuum robots allow to estimate forces and torques at the operational point by monitoring loads along their actuation lines without the need for a dedicated transducer at the operational point. This capability is indeed crucial in emerging fields such as robotic surgery where cost and strict sterilization guidelines prevent the adoption of a dedicated sensor to provide force feedback from the sterile field. To advance further the force sensing capabilities of multi-backbone continuum robots, we present a new framework for hybrid motion and force control of continuum robots with intrinsic force sensing capabilities. The framework is based on a kinetostatic modeling of the multi-backbone continuum robot with, a simplified model for online estimate of the manipulator's compliance, and a new strategy for merging force and motion control laws in the configuration space of the manipulator. Experimental results show the ability to sense and regulate forces at the operational point and evaluate the framework for shape exploration and stiffness imaging in flexible environments.},

The primary benefit of the proposed method is that the dynamic equations are represented by a set of ODE's in time instead of PDE's in time and space, and the new curvature gradient lumped parameter model is used. A sliding mode control system is used in order to achieve the desired shape of the arm. The stability of the closed-loop control system is proven.

Surgical robots have the potential to meet this need yet often disrupt the clinical workflow. Hand-held robots that combine thin manipulators and endoscopes have the potential to address this by integrating seamlessly into the clinical workflow and enhancing dexterity. As a case study illustrating the potential of this approach, we describe a hand-held robotic system that passes two concentric tube manipulators through a 5\,mm port in a rigid endoscope for transurethral laser prostate surgery. This system is intended to catalyze the use of a clinically superior, yet rarely attempted, procedure for benign prostatic hyperplasia. This paper describes system design and experiments to evaluate the surgeon's functional workspace and accuracy using the robot.

Then, we present a strategy for independently identifying all unknown components of the system: the soft manipulator, its distributed fluidic elastomer actuators, as well as drive cylinders that supply fluid energy. Next, using this model and trajectory optimization techniques we find locally optimal open-loop policies that allow the system to perform dynamic maneuvers we call grabs. In 37 experimental trials with a physical prototype, we successfully perform a grab 92\% of the time. By studying such an extreme example of a soft robot, we can begin to solve hard problems inhibiting the mainstream use of soft machines.},

They have been employed in a variety of applications ranging from search-and-rescue to minimally invasive surgical procedures, and recently they even have been proposed as solutions to problems in maintaining civil infrastructure and the repair of satellites. The kinematic and dynamic properties of snakelike robots are captured naturally using a continuum backbone curve equipped with a naturally evolving set of reference frames, stiffness properties, and mass density. When the snakelike robot has a continuum architecture, the backbone curve corresponds with the physical device itself. Interestingly, these same modeling ideas can be used to describe conformational shapes of DNA molecules and filamentous protein structures in solution and in cells. This paper reviews several classes of snakelike robots: (1) hyper-redundant manipulators guided by backbone curves; (2) flexible steerable needles; and (3) concentric tube continuum robots. It is then shown how the same mathematical modeling methods used in these robotics contexts can be used to model molecules such as DNA. All of these problems are treated in the context of a common mathematical framework based on the differential geometry of curves, continuum mechanics, and variational calculus. Both coordinate-dependent Euler\textendash{}Lagrange formulations and coordinate-free Euler\textendash{}Poincar{\'e} approaches are reviewed.},

In the case of a catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation, the compliance of the continuum backbone lends an inherent safety to the device. This inherent safety frustrates attempts at precise, accurate, and fast control, limiting the continuum devices to simple and static positioning tasks. This paper develops interleaved continuum-rigid manipulation, by which the hysteretic nonlinearities encountered in tendon-actuated continuum manipulators are compensated by the discrete rigid joints located between the continuum sections. The rigid joints introduce an actuation redundancy, which an interleaved controller may use to avoid the continuum nonlinearities and dynamic excitations, or to prefer particular configurations that may improve task accuracy, permit greater end-effector forces, or avoid environment obstacles. Two experimental systems explore the potential of these joints to: 1) increase the manipulator's dexterous workspace, and 2) correct for actuation nonlinearities and enhance manipulator performance. These experiments also expose important design and control observations that were not apparent in the general robotic and continuum literature.},

  abstract = {In the previous decade, multiple approaches for kinematic controllers of continuum manipulators were successfully developed. However, for fast and exact motions of continuum robots that are hardly seen so far, dynamic controllers are necessary-especially for spatial manipulators with multiple sections. Therefore, a dynamic controller in actuator space is developed that both exploits input constraints and decouples the actuators in order to provide a good and intuitive dynamic behavior of the manipulator. Having a pneumatically actuated manipulator with multiple actuators, this can be achieved using a cascaded control approach with a centralized actuator length controller and an underlying decoupled pneumatic controller. For both the outer multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) controller and the inner single-input single-output (SISO) controllers, model-based controllers are developed based on suitable models using feedback linearization and a combination of feedforward control and linear PD-controllers. The resulting actuator controller can be used for tracking optimized trajectories in actuator space and also for possible extensions towards direct tool center point feedback.},

  abstract = {Robot manipulators are increasingly used in minimally invasive surgery (MIS). They are required to have small size, wide workspace, adequate dexterity and payload ability when operating in confined surgical cavity. Snake-like flexible manipulators are well suited to these applications. However, conventional fully actuated snake-like flexible manipulators are difficult to miniaturize and even after miniaturization the payload is very limited. The alternative is to use underactuated snake-like flexible manipulators. Three prevailing designs are tendon-driven continuum manipulators (TCM), tendon-driven serpentine manipulators (TSM) and concentric tube manipulators (CTM). In this paper, the three designs are compared at the mechanism level from the kinematics point of view. The workspace and distal end dexterity are compared for TCM, TSM and CTM with one, two and three sections, respectively. Other aspects of these designs are also discussed, including sweeping motion, scaling, force sensing, stiffness control, etc. From the results, the tendon-driven designs and concentric tube design complement each other in terms of their workspace, which is influenced by the number of sections as well as the length distribution among sections. The tendon-driven designs entail better distal end dexterity while generate larger sweeping motion in positions close to the shaft.},

We present hereby an improvement of this kinematic structure based on embedded soft micro-actuators. Two models for single and double direction curvature control are introduced. We demonstrate that kinematics are enhanced with respect to the standard approach in terms of holonomy, actuation redundancy and workspace covering. Further kinematic analysis enables the detection of singular configurations. The number of the end-effector pose occurrences that can be reached in a given volume (one cubic millimeter) are computed as well. Finally, the advantages of the novel structures are proven using performance indices.},

  abstract = {Continuum manipulators are a rapidly emerging class of robots. However, due to the complexity of their mathematical models and modeling inaccuracies, the development of effective control systems is a particularly challenging task. This paper presents the first attempt on kinematic control of continuum manipulators using a fuzzy-model-based approach. A fuzzy controller is proposed for autonomous execution of end-effector trajectory tracking tasks for a continuum manipulator. Particularly, membership functions are employed to combine the linearized state-space models, to achieve, overall, a fuzzy model. The fuzzy model can help design the fuzzy controller; in our approach, this process is supported by a thorough stability analysis. This control methodology enables a solution with low computational requirements to this motion control problem - there is no need to continuously update the Jacobian of the continuum manipulator. The superior performance of this controller is validated in MATLAB simulations and compared with those of classical controllers found in the literature. The experiments on a rapid-prototyped continuum manipulator further verify the feasibility and the advantages of this fuzzy controller in the presence of modeling discrepancies and hardware inaccuracies.},

Robots created under this paradigm offer many advantages and represent unique features in terms of flexibility, dexterity, safety, and weight reduction. This paper introduces a novel continuum manipulator that integrates multiple layers of compliant planar springs-a structure that provides several notable advantages over existing designs. First, it possesses precise linear large-displacement motion. In this context, we utilize the linear output motion of each layer of springs. With the serial connection of multiple conjoined layers, the manipulator demonstrates linear predictable bending even when executing large bends. An analytical method is provided to study the compliance characteristics of the planar spring and derive the compliance matrix to represent the force-deflection relationships, allowing an accurate motion prediction. Second, compared with work elsewhere, this structure demonstrates an effective way of decoupling bending from contraction and expansion. It reduces the uncontrolled compression when generating normal deflections, thus controlling robot bending is simplified. Third, the reachable workspace of the end effector is enlarged by means of varying the length of the continuum manipulator via controlled contraction and expansion. A 3-D printed prototype of this continuum manipulator is experimentally evaluated. The conducted experiments demonstrated validity of our approach.},

First, we develop a dynamic model for a multi-body fluidic elastomer manipulator that is composed entirely from soft rubber and subject to the self-loading effects of gravity. Then, we present a strategy for independently identifying all of the unknown components of the system; these are the soft manipulator, its distributed fluidic elastomer actuators, as well as the drive cylinders that supply fluid energy. Next, using this model and trajectory-optimization techniques we find locally-optimal open-loop policies that allow the system to perform dynamic maneuvers we call grabs. In 37 experimental trials with a physical prototype, we successfully perform a grab 92\% of the time. Last, we introduce the idea of static bracing for a soft elastomer arm and discuss how forming environmental braces might be an effective manipulation strategy for this class of robots. By studying such an extreme example of a soft robot, we can begin to solve hard problems inhibiting the mainstream use of soft machines.},

Meeting these constraints requires implementing a complex mechanical and electrical architecture. Here we present our solution, which involves the construction of sixteen aluminum modules and creation of the Super Servo, a modified hobby servo. To create the Super Servo, we have replaced the electronics in a hobby servo, adding such components as sensors to monitor current and temperature, a communications bus, and a programmable microcontroller. Any robust solution must also protect components from hazardous environments such as sand and brush. To resolve this problem we insert the robots into skins that cover their surface. Functions such as climbing the inside and outside of a pipe add a new dimension of interaction. Thus we attach a compliant, high-friction material to every module, which assists in tasks that require gripping. This combination of the mechanical and electrical architectures results in a robust and versatile robot.},

  abstract = {It is often difficult for orthopedic surgeons to avoid LCL injury during ACL reconstruction. In this paper, we developed a steerable drill for ACL reconstruction to avoid LCL injury in the process of making a bone tunnel. There are two special requirements for the steerable drill mechanism. One is having sufficient flexibility to bend and avoid LCL while cutting the bone. The other is rigidity to avoid the buckle at the base of the drill when external force is exerted on the drill tip. These two requirements cannot be met simultaneously by using the previous material with uniform stiffness throughout its length. We therefore adopted a spring sheath with stiffness that varied between the top and base of the drill. This spring sheath has high stiffness at the base and low stiffness at the top. We performed the experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of the drill with uniform and non-uniform stiffness by comparing each result. Consequently, it was confirmed that the drill with non-uniform stiffness achieved 6 times the bending deformation and with 30\% lower force as preventing the buckling compared to the drill with uniform stiffness. Subsequently, we presented a discussion concerning the reason for the experimental result, based on a physical long column model which simulated the steerable drill. In addition, at the end of this paper, a newly-developed control method to make the arbitrary trajectory of the bone tunnel using a steerable drill with non-uniform stiffness was described.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a bio-inspired wire-driven multi-section flexible robot. It is inspired by the snake skeleton and octopus arm muscle arrangements. The robot consists of three sections and each section is made up of several identical vertebras, which are articulated by both spherical joints and a flexible backbone. Each section is driven by two groups of wires, controlling the bending motion in X and Y directions. This design integrates the serpentine robots' structure and the continuum robots' actuation. As a result, it is more compact than traditional serpentine robots and has a higher positioning accuracy than typical continuum soft robots, such as OctArm V. A Kinematics model and a workspace model of the robot are developed based on the piece wise constant curvature assumption. To evaluate the design, a prototype is built and experiments are carried out. The average distal end positioning error is less than 4\%. Characteristics of the wire-driven robot are also discussed, including the leverage effect and the manipulability under constraint. These features makes the proposed robot well suited to confined spaces, especially for working in minimally invasive surgery, nuclear reactor pipelines, disaster debris, etc.},

The manipulator is designed for surgical applications with a preliminary focus on the removal of osteolysis formed behind the acetabular shell of primary total hip arthroplasties (THAs). The manipulator is constructed from two nested superelastic nitinol tubes enabling lengthwise channels for drive cables. Notches in the nested assembly provide reliable bending under applied cable tension producing kinematics that can be effectively modeled as a series of rigid vertebrae connected using pin joints. The manipulator is controlled in plane with two independently actuated cables in a pull-pull configuration. For the purpose of the procedure, the manipulator is mounted on a Z-\texttheta{} stage adding a translational and rotational degree of freedom (DOF) along the axis of the manipulator. Preliminary experimental results demonstrate the initial modeling and control of the manipulator.},

  doi = {10.1109/IROS.2015.7353661},
  abstract = {Tendon-driven continuum robots offer increased dexterity and manipulability in comparison to conventional rigid link serial manipulators. Being able to conform to complex curves in 3D space, continuum robots are in particular useful for applications in restricted and hardly accessible environments. The workspace of a tendon-driven continuum robot depends on the number of sections, as well as the length of each section and its range of bending radii. Common tendon-driven robot designs have fixed section lengths such that deployment along a tortuous paths requires additional linear translation of the whole robot. In this paper, we propose a novel tendon-driven continuum robot with extensible sections. A telescoping backbone allows control of the section length during operation in addition to bending through tendon actuation. Thus, the arc length of a section can vary and the range of bending radii is enlarged. As a result, the novel robot design inherently allows for deployment along tortuous paths in a follow-the-leader fashion. We suggest the use of spacer disks equipped with permanent magnets with alternating pole orientation. The magnetic repulsion forces enable equidistant spacing of the disks at any lengths of a robot section. We prove the concepts of our novel design with experiments using a first prototype.},

  abstract = {Complex controlled motions, soft human interaction, and minimal moving mass all drive the need for soft robots using fluid filled fiber reinforced elastomer enclosures (FREEs). While a narrow class of FREEs known as McKibben's actuators have been extensively studied, there is a wide unexplored class with complex sets of motion patterns. Combining these actuators in parallel can yield versatile motion patterns resulting in a large overall workspace. Mobility of individual actuators is enforced by inextensibility of fibers and incompressibility of fluids, which in turn drives the net attainable motions. In this paper, we map the mobility of individual FREE actuators to all possible resultant motions that a combination of three sets of actuators arranged in a triangular configuration would undergo. This understanding has resulted in a preliminary design tool that determines individual FREE topologies for a required set of motion patterns. Five case studies that result from this methodology are prototyped and tested for comparison of the predicted and obtained motion directions.},

This is a thorough review of the literature on the nature and development of this device with emphasis on surgical applications. We have reviewed the published literature and classified robotic arms by their application: show, industrial application, medical application, etc. There is a definite trend in the manufacture of robotic arms toward more dextrous devices, more degrees-of-freedom, and capabilities beyond the human arm. da Vinci designed the first sophisticated robotic arm in 1495 with four degrees-of-freedom and an analog on-board controller supplying power and programmability. von Kemplen's chess-playing automaton left arm was quite sophisticated. Unimate introduced the first industrial robotic arm in 1961, it has subsequently evolved into the PUMA arm. In 1963 the Rancho arm was designed; Minsky's Tentacle arm appeared in 1968, Scheinman's Stanford arm in 1969, and MIT's Silver arm in 1974. Aird became the first cyborg human with a robotic arm in 1993. In 2000 Miguel Nicolalis redefined possible man\textendash{}machine capacity in his work on cerebral implantation in owl-monkeys directly interfacing with robotic arms both locally and at a distance. The robotic arm is the end-effector of robotic systems and currently is the hallmark feature of the da Vinci Surgical System making its entrance into surgical application. But, despite the potential advantages of this computer-controlled master\textendash{}slave system, robotic arms have definite limitations. Ongoing work in robotics has many potential solutions to the drawbacks of current robotic surgical systems.$<$/p$>$},

  abstract = {Hyper-redundant, or 'snake-like', manipulators have a very large number of actuatable degrees of freedom. This paper develops an efficient formulation of approximate hyper-redundant manipulator dynamics. The most efficient methods for representing manipulator dynamics in the literature require serial computations proportional to the number of degrees of freedom. Furthermore, these methods are not fully parallelizable. For hyper-redundant manipulators, which may have tens, hundreds or thousands of actuators, these formulations preclude real time implementation. This paper therefore looks at the mechanics of hyper-redundant manipulators from the point of view of an approximation to an 'infinite degree-or-freedom' (or continuum) problem. The dynamics for this case is developed. The approximate dynamics of actual hyper-redundant manipulators is then reduced to a problem which is O(1) in time, i.e. the algorithm is O(n) is the total number of computations, but these computations can be completely distributed over n parallel processors. This is achieved by 'projecting' the dynamics of the continuum model onto the actual robotic structure. Applications of this method to practical computed torque control schemes for hyper-redundant manipulators is demonstrated with two examples: (i) industrial pick-and-place tasks and (ii) inspection in an environment filled with viscous sludge, such as a hazardous waste dump. The results are compared with a lumped mass model of a particular hyper-redundant manipulator.},

The model consists of a finite number of segments, each segment having a specific structure and control. The dynamic behaviour of the arm is obtained using Lagrange's principle developed for infinite-dimensional systems. This model is represented by a set of integral-differential equations. An approximate model is then derived as a set of differential equations with variable coefficients. Two cases are discussed: the sliding mode with the bang-bang control; and the direct mode in which the controller is based on the use of the direct evolution of the system on the switching line by switching the fluid viscosity. The numerical simulations are presented. A nonlinear observer is introduced to estimate the inaccessible state variable distributed on the length of the arm. The conditions which assure the convergence to zero of the errors are proved},

Tendril, NASA's latest robot designed for minimally invasive inspection, is one system born of this effort. Inspired by the biology of snakes, tentacles, and climbing plants, the Tendril robot is a long slender manipulator that can extend deep into crevasses and under thermal blankets to inspect areas largely inaccessible by conventional means. The design of the Tendril, with its multiple bending segments and 1 cm diameter, also serves as an initial step in exploring the whole body control known to continuum robots coupled with the small scale and dexterity found in medical and commercial minimally invasive devices. An overview of Tendril's design is presented along with preliminary results from testing that seeks to improve Tendril's performance through an iterative design process},

Third, it possesses ideal back-drivability and a low hysteresis. We further provide an analytical method to study the compliance characteristics of the planar module and derive the statics and kinematics of the robot.

  abstract = {We have developed a new class of continuously flexible snake-like robots, called active cannulas, that consist of several telescoping pre-curved superelastic tubes. The devices derive bending actuation not from tendon wires or other external mechanisms, but from elastic energy stored in the backbone itself. This allows active cannulas to have a small diameter and a high degree of dexterity, which should enable them to navigate through complex anatomy to sites inaccessible by current surgical robotic devices. Active cannulas may also enhance patient safety because their inherent compliance mitigates potential trauma from inadvertent tool-tissue collision. A consequence of our design is that dexterity improves with miniaturization. A kinematic description of active cannula shape requires a model of the elastic interaction of telescoping pre-curved flexible tubes, and we derive a two-link beam mechanics-based model. Experiments using curved nitinol tubes and wires validate the model},

The octopus is a boneless animal and its amazing dexterity is due to its muscular structure where longitudinal (axial), transverse (radial) and oblique muscles seamlessly interact while preserving hydrostaticity i.e. volume conservation (``muscular hydrostat''). Mimicking some features of the octopus is instrumental to design a dexterous and compliant system. After analysing the relevant anatomical and morphological characteristics of the octopus arm, the key biomechanical features of interest to the design of a robotic arm have been identified. A design methodology has been developed based on the analysis of the muscular hydrostat properties. A prototype arm has been built using bespoke contracting pneumatic muscles and expanding elements. In the current stage of development the system has 15 actuated degrees of motion (DOM) and 8 degrees of freedom (DOF), all independently controllable through valves and a dedicated electronics and software interface. Pros and cons of the current design as well as practical prototyping trade-offs are thoroughly described.},

The octopus arm shows peculiar features, such as the ability to bend in all directions, to produce fast elongations, and to vary its stiffness. The octopus achieves these unique motor skills, thanks to its peculiar muscular structure, named muscular hydrostat. Different muscles arranged on orthogonal planes generate an antagonistic action on each other in the muscular hydrostat, which does not change its volume during muscle contractions, and allow bending and elongation of the arm and stiffness variation. By drawing inspiration from natural skills of octopus, and by analysing the geometry and mechanics of the muscular structure of its arm, we propose the design of a robot arm consisting of an artificial muscular hydrostat structure, which is completely soft and compliant, but also able to stiffen. In this paper, we discuss the design criteria of the robotic arm and how this design and the special arrangement of its muscular structure may bring the building of a robotic arm into being, by showing the results obtained by mathematical models and prototypical mock-ups.},

This will enable us to deliver diagnostic as well as therapeutic devices to the target location through the hollow inner core of the cannula. We propose to use SMAs to generate bending forces due to its small size and high power density. We annealed the SMA wires through a customized training process in an arc shape and mounted them at discrete locations on the outer surface of the cannula to enable joint motion. A pulse-width modulation (PWM)-based control scheme was implemented to control all SMA actuators simultaneously to enable multiple joint motion using a single power supply. The proposed controller was validated through an experiment inside gelatin to mimic the motion of the cannula inside a medium which requires a significant amount of force to move the joints of the cannula. Trajectory planning using a suitable metric and trajectory execution were successfully implemented. To demonstrate the delivery of a diagnostic tool through our cannula, we demonstrate that we can pass an optical coherence tomography probe through the cannula and perform in situ microscale imaging.},

  abstract = {This paper presents novel and efficient kinematic modeling techniques for ``hyper-redundant'' robots. This approach is based on a ``backbone curve'' that captures the robot's macroscopic geometric features. The inverse kinematic, or ``hyper-redundancy resolution,'' problem reduces to determining the time varying backbone curve behavior. To efficiently solve the inverse kinematics problem, the authors introduce a ``modal'' approach, in which a set of intrinsic backbone curve shape functions are restricted to a modal form. The singularities of the modal approach, modal non-degeneracy conditions, and modal switching are considered. For discretely segmented morphologies, the authors introduce ``fitting'' algorithms that determine the actuator displacements that cause the discrete manipulator to adhere to the backbone curve. These techniques are demonstrated with planar and spatial mechanism examples. They have also been implemented on a 30 degree-of-freedom robot prototype},

In this paper, a general mechanical model with a geometrically exact approach for tendon-driven continuum manipulators is presented. This model can be applied to a wide range of manipulators thanks to the generality of the parameters which can be set. The approach proposed could as well be a powerful tool for developing the control strategy. The model is also capable of properly simulating the coupled tendon drive, because it takes into account the torsion of the robot arm rather than neglecting it, as it is common practice in other existing models.},

Unlike traditional rigid-link robot manipulators, continuum robot manipulators do not have rigid joints, hence these manipulators are extremely dexterous, compliant, and are capable of dynamic adaptive manipulation in unstructured environments. However, the development of high-performance control algorithms for these manipulators is quite a challenge, due to their unique design and the high degree of uncertainty in their dynamic models. In this paper, a controller for continuum robots, which utilizes a neural network feedforward component to compensate for dynamic uncertainties is presented. Experimental results using the OCTARM, which is a soft extensible continuum manipulator, are provided to illustrate that the addition of the neural network feedforward component to the controller provides improved performance.},

We show the success of the method in extensive real-world experiments on the nonstationary robot, including a novel combination of learning and traditional feedback control. Simulations further investigate the impact of nonstationary actuation ranges, drifting sensors, and morphological changes. The experiments provide the first substantial quantitative real-world evidence for the success of goal-directed bootstrapping schemes, moreover with the challenge of nonstationary system behavior. We thereby provide the first functioning control concept for this challenging robot platform.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with a methodology for real-time solving of a complex kinematics of a class of continuum manipulators, namely the compact bionic handling assistant (CBHA). First, a quantitative approach is used to model kinematically the CBHA inspired from the modeling of parallel rigid manipulators. For this case, the CBHA is modeled as a series of vertebrae, where each vertebra is connected to the next one through a flexible link. The latter named an intervertebra is modeled by three universal-prismatic-spherical and one universal-prismatic joints. The kinematic models of the CBHA are derived from the inverse kinematic equations (IKE) of each intervertebra. A qualitative approach based on neural networks is used to provide approximated solutions of the IKE for real-time implementation. Thus, the combination of the advantages of quantitative and qualitative approaches allows proposing a hybrid methodology for accurate modeling and solving the kinematics of this class of continuum robots. A set of experiments is conducted using a CBHA in order to evaluate the level of efficiency of the proposed hybrid approach.},
